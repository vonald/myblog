        <p>The mad thing is, now that we have all become hunter-gatherers again, my wife and I are going into shops more than we ever normally would. While we are not completely out of staple goods, we are finding it nigh on impossible to restock them.</p>

<p>Our village farm shop are being brilliant at supplying fresh produce and dairy goods. And we are still getting our weekly veg box. Presumably the panic-buyers will at some point run out of space in which to stockpile?</p>

<p>I was able to stop in a small shop this morning and get a few supplies. Never before have I felt such a burst of exhilaration from buying some cereal, two bags of pasta and a tin of kidney beans.</p>

        <p>As an IndieWeb newbie I am very much still getting to grips with many aspects of applying the principles to my Wordpress blog. I had been struggling with how to implement reply-contexts until I came across this article by <a href="https://boffosocko.com/" target="_blank">Chris Aldrich</a> where he explains very clearly how to use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/" target="_blank">Post Kinds plugin</a>. I hadn&rsquo;t discovered the Response Properties box available in the post editor up until this point, but now I have I can show neat looking links, excerpts and author details for anything that I am replying to or commenting on. This post being a case in point.</p>

        <p>Re struggling to write, the paradox is that it is at times like the last week or so when I <em>want</em> to write more. There is so much going on, so much to assimilate and adapt to, and yet actually distilling the jumble of thoughts and reactions is hard.</p>

        <p>I have found it hard to write this week. Anxiety, tiredness and addressing the banal have consumed any time or energy that I might otherwise have had to write. Thoughts have passed through my head and some I have even jotted down, but putting them together into something coherent has felt beyond my reach.</p>

<p>The beginning of the week was not easy. My wife and I are both self-employed and what with a lack of financial help from the government and the start of the lockdown, to say my anxiety went through the roof is not an overstatement. I know there are many who are in an even more precarious position but nonetheless this was not a place I wanted to be in. I don’t think it helped knowing that the government was quite generously helping others. Difficult not to feel angry.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I think I my body ran on adrenaline alone, as my mind spent the day whirling around, catastrophising and doing its fight-or-flight dance of agitation. It didn’t help that the mobile networks seemed to be down either so trying to make phone calls was nigh on impossible.</p>

<p>Subsequently, I was exhausted and ended up having tension headaches for most of the week.</p>

<p>Thankfully, put under pressure to act, the government have now done something similar for the self-employed, so we can relax a little knowing there is a safety net.</p>

<p>I am due to get my next batch of meds and discovered that our surgery is currently unable to get them. Luckily a local pharmacy has them so no problems there but does this mean more people are being prescribed antidepressants because of the pandemic?</p>

<p>On a more human level there has been a second positive to the week. I don’t find it easy to trust people - not an uncommon thing, but I think my mental health issues contribute towards a difficulty with interpersonal relationships. But over the week I have seen a side to people that I don’t expect. By its very nature, the relationship we have with our clients is transcactional - I don’t expect any more from them. But some of them have gone beyond that this week in understated ways that show they think of us as people and not just a business.</p>

<p>And that means a lot.</p>
