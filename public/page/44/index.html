        <p>At the weekend we watched <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/?ref=m_nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Arrival</em></a>. It has been on my list of films to see and happened to be on TV. A really thought provoking film and for me the kind of storytelling when sci-fi is at its best. I will now have to read the novella it is based on - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life" target="_blank"><em>Story of Your Life</em></a> by Ted Chiang.</p>

<p>Funnily, I was thinking about <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/" target="_blank"><em>Bladerunner 2049</em></a> - another of Denis Villeneuve&rsquo;s films, after reading <a href="https://colinwalker.blog/2019/11/28/" target="_blank">Colin Walker‚Äôs post</a> about watching it on his phone. I have yet to see it, having hesitated to do so after watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3397884/" target="_blank"><em>Sicario</em></a> for which my expecations were high. Yet another of Villeneuve&rsquo;s films, I had heard great things about <em>Sicario</em> but was disappointed with it. Great set pieces and music, but I thought Emily Blunt&rsquo;s character lacked agency, rendering her a mere observer. Maybe that was the point but it didn&rsquo;t work for me (yes, I know she was there as an FBI agent in order to legitimise the operation etc).</p>

<p><em>Bladerunner</em> holds a special place in my imagination - any sequel has to measure up, and based on <em>Sicario</em> and my reaction to it, I haven&rsquo;t quite got around to watching <em>2049</em> yet. However, having now seen <em>Arrival</em> and thought it had some heft to it, I think I can go ahead and watch <em>Bladerunner 2049</em> with confidence.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder how much it pays to know about a film in advance of viewing it? Obviously you have to have enough information to decide whether it is for you or not. I had <em>Sicario</em> on my list of must see films after hearing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p034t459" target="_blank">Mark Kermode&rsquo;s review</a> and it was almost like I knew <em>too</em> much about it and his opinion, meaning I had a specific expectation that was ultimately not met.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I knew very little about <em>Arrival</em> and consequently was able to watch it with few preconceptions to get in the way. I just took it as it came and as such was a better viewing experience for it. I will have to watch <em>Sicario</em> again at a later date, and maybe it will work better on a second viewing.</p>

        <p>I mentioned a few days ago that I was trying out a note-taking/markdown app called <a href="https://joplinapp.org" target="_blank">Joplin</a>. I had not heard of it before, but I had read a short review of it and thought it sounded worth a go.</p>

<p>So far I like it. The UI of both the iPhone and Mac apps could do with some polish but are elegant enough. Not pretty but get the job done.</p>

<p>What I do like is the following;<br />
-  <strong>Markdown</strong>. I use markdown for blog posting and files are saved in markdown format. Plaintext has been my preference so that files can be read by most apps, but markdown is fine. What I don&rsquo;t like are proprietory file types that lock you into a particular app.<br />
-  <strong>Sync to Dropbox</strong>. Storing files on Dropbox means they can be accessed from other apps or even different operating systems, should I so wish.<br />
- <strong>Universal</strong>. Joplin is available on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS.<br />
- <strong>Full text search</strong>. Just makes searching for <em>anything</em> so much easier.<br />
- <strong>macOS split pane</strong>. Both the editor screen and markdown preview screen can be displayed side by side so it is easy to see how your text looks in markdown as you work.</p>

<p>As you can probably see, I don&rsquo;t like to be tied into one system. If I ever move to another I want to be able to still easily access my notes. For that very reason I can see myself sticking with Joplin for the time being. Just until I get the urge to try something different&hellip;</p>
