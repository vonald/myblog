        <p>There is a lane near us running alongside some woodland that is open to the public. It&rsquo;s fair to say the road has seen an increase in traffic over the pandemic, given more people seem to be using the wood for exercise. As a result the already poor road surface has deteriorated badly with several potholes opening up.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I noticed red marker paint around the worst of the holes. Given the usual glacial pace that these things seem to move at, I was pleasantly surprised this morning to see the holes have been patched. So well done Highways Agency or whoever is responsible.</p>

<p>Clearly though, there is something of the arcane to the decision making process here, because why only repair some of the holes?</p>

        <p>Warm enough to sit out in the garden with a cup of coffee - always an important marker in the spring. The blue tits are very busy around the nest box, watched them bossing other birds around, doing display flights and so on.</p>

        <p>Harumph. My Nextcloud server has stopped working. I have had a poke around, and it looks like it may be something to do with the SSL certificate auto-renewing. I get an error message telling me one of the key files is missing. Except it is quite clearly there. This is where my lack of knowledge shows up. When something goes wrong.</p>

<p>I guess this is the challenge for a non-tech person trying to DIY their blog/website/internet experience. It is OK following good instructions and tutorials and picking up knowledge as you go along. But there is always a limit, and sooner or later you are going to bump up against that.</p>

<p>For now, I am going to use my Dropbox storage instead of Nextcloud, and see if I can diagnose the problem as and when. In the longer term, I am not sure if I would retain the Nextcloud server anyway as I would prefer to use Syncthing - it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s not available for the iPhone so Nextcloud is a bit of a work around.</p>

        <p>I have now created a basic website for the blog using Hugo. I&rsquo;ve gone the GitHub/Netlify route so have a local repository on the Raspberry pi which I can then push to GitHub. Netlify then automatically deploys the site. I&rsquo;ve yet to redirect my domain there and will hold off from doing so while I do further tinkering.</p>

<p>I had <a href="https://strandlines.blog/1109-2/" target="_blank"> wondered how I would go about posting to the site</a>, so I spent some time last weekend fiddling around. I&rsquo;m happy with what I&rsquo;ve come up with.</p>

<p>I do the majority of writing for the blog on my phone, using <a href="https://getdrafts.com" target="_blank">Drafts</a>. So that had to be the starting point. Drafts does not have an SSH option to save files to but it does have WebDAV. This means I can save a file to my <a href="https://nextcloud.com" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a> server on the pi, so I&rsquo;ve created an action in Drafts that adds front matter to the post and then saves it with a date based file name to Nextcloud. So far so good.</p>

<p>My Nextcloud files are saved on a USB stick on the pi, and so the next thing is to pull the post file from there into the content folder in the local git repo on the pi. With me so far?</p>

<p>I did this by using <a href="https://rclone.org" target="_blank">rclone</a> to sync the Nextcloud folder where blog posts are saved to the content folder on the pi. I&rsquo;ve set this up as a cron job which runs every 15mins.</p>

<p>Finally, I wrote a bash script that runs a git pull/add/commit/push action that again, is saved as a cron job and runs at similar intervals to the other one.</p>

<p>As mentioned at the beginning, <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a> does the rest.</p>

<p>Sounds convoluted, but in practice, all I now have to do when I&rsquo;ve written a post is to run the Drafts action. The rest is automated. So from my end, it&rsquo;s very low friction, which is what I was aiming for.</p>

        <p>So that&rsquo;s the end of the cold snap. It is so different out there this morning - calm, misty and a positively balmy 9C.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of days the cold weather has emboldened the birds again and this time a song thrush came to the bird table. They do come into the garden frequently but I&rsquo;ve never seen one come this close to the house.</p>

<p>It was very cautious initially, spending a lot of time looking around before dipping its head to take some food. It was also pretty shy of other birds so would fly off if others came to the table. Over time it appeared to become more confident spending less time looking around and more time feeding. They have beautiful markings and it&rsquo;s a real treat to see one so close.</p>
