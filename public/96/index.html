      <p>At the weekend we watched <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/?ref=m_nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Arrival</em></a>. It has been on my list of films to see and happened to be on TV. A really thought provoking film and for me the kind of storytelling when sci-fi is at its best. I will now have to read the novella it is based on - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life" target="_blank"><em>Story of Your Life</em></a> by Ted Chiang.</p>

<p>Funnily, I was thinking about <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/" target="_blank"><em>Bladerunner 2049</em></a> - another of Denis Villeneuve&rsquo;s films, after reading <a href="https://colinwalker.blog/2019/11/28/" target="_blank">Colin Walker’s post</a> about watching it on his phone. I have yet to see it, having hesitated to do so after watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3397884/" target="_blank"><em>Sicario</em></a> for which my expecations were high. Yet another of Villeneuve&rsquo;s films, I had heard great things about <em>Sicario</em> but was disappointed with it. Great set pieces and music, but I thought Emily Blunt&rsquo;s character lacked agency, rendering her a mere observer. Maybe that was the point but it didn&rsquo;t work for me (yes, I know she was there as an FBI agent in order to legitimise the operation etc).</p>

<p><em>Bladerunner</em> holds a special place in my imagination - any sequel has to measure up, and based on <em>Sicario</em> and my reaction to it, I haven&rsquo;t quite got around to watching <em>2049</em> yet. However, having now seen <em>Arrival</em> and thought it had some heft to it, I think I can go ahead and watch <em>Bladerunner 2049</em> with confidence.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder how much it pays to know about a film in advance of viewing it? Obviously you have to have enough information to decide whether it is for you or not. I had <em>Sicario</em> on my list of must see films after hearing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p034t459" target="_blank">Mark Kermode&rsquo;s review</a> and it was almost like I knew <em>too</em> much about it and his opinion, meaning I had a specific expectation that was ultimately not met.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I knew very little about <em>Arrival</em> and consequently was able to watch it with few preconceptions to get in the way. I just took it as it came and as such was a better viewing experience for it. I will have to watch <em>Sicario</em> again at a later date, and maybe it will work better on a second viewing.</p>
