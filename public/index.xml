      <description>There is a lane near us running alongside some woodland that is open to the public. It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say the road has seen an increase in traffic over the pandemic, given more people seem to be using the wood for exercise. As a result the already poor road surface has deteriorated badly with several potholes opening up.
A couple of weeks ago I noticed red marker paint around the worst of the holes.</description>

      <description>Warm enough to sit out in the garden with a cup of coffee - always an important marker in the spring. The blue tits are very busy around the nest box, watched them bossing other birds around, doing display flights and so on.</description>

      <description>Harumph. My Nextcloud server has stopped working. I have had a poke around, and it looks like it may be something to do with the SSL certificate auto-renewing. I get an error message telling me one of the key files is missing. Except it is quite clearly there. This is where my lack of knowledge shows up. When something goes wrong.
I guess this is the challenge for a non-tech person trying to DIY their blog/website/internet experience.</description>

      <description>I have now created a basic website for the blog using Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone the GitHub/Netlify route so have a local repository on the Raspberry pi which I can then push to GitHub. Netlify then automatically deploys the site. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to redirect my domain there and will hold off from doing so while I do further tinkering.
I had wondered how I would go about posting to the site, so I spent some time last weekend fiddling around.</description>

      <description>So that&amp;rsquo;s the end of the cold snap. It is so different out there this morning - calm, misty and a positively balmy 9C.
Over the last couple of days the cold weather has emboldened the birds again and this time a song thrush came to the bird table. They do come into the garden frequently but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen one come this close to the house.
It was very cautious initially, spending a lot of time looking around before dipping its head to take some food.</description>

      <description>Eng v Ind. Having seen how much turn there was on day 1 you know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be hard for England batting 2nd. And is it just. India are having their day - Ashwin&amp;rsquo;s bowling of Stokes was superb.</description>

      <description>Having got up at 4am for the start of the Eng v Ind test yesterday, it‚Äôs too much of a stretch to do so again today. Root is looking very relaxed out there, on 182 as I write this. Top of his game. üèè</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs blowy, wet and cold out there this morning. But I could hear a blackbird singing. First one of the year. And not it‚Äôs winter sub-song but the full-phrase version.
So while it‚Äôs still winter in that damp way we seem to specialise in here, you can hear spring coming.</description>

      <description>Watched the first episode of Lupin. I‚Äôm always a sucker for a good heist story and thoroughly enjoyed it. Netflix automatically started showing it in the English dubbed version but I much preferred it in the original French with subtitles.</description>

      <description>A couple centimetres of snow this morning. Funny how that completely changes the dynamic of the bird interactions at our feeders. As a rule each species tends to keep a respectful distance from each other. The sparrows are a boisterous lot and are generally a bit much for the blue tits. But then the robins usually see off the sparrows, and pretty much anyone else. Today, particularly on the table where we put old apples and bird seed, they were all piling in, the need for food taking precedence over any kind of hierarchy.</description>

      <description>The sun is out and I‚Äôve got Test Match Special on the radio, listening to Eng v Sri Lanka. If I ignore the just-above-zero temperature and the possibility of snow later on, I could almost imagine it‚Äôs summer.</description>

      <description>The hosting for my blog is up for renewal in a month or so. It occurred to me to look into the viability of using the raspberry pi as the web server, making it a truly self-hosted blog.
From what I‚Äôve read it should be ok for a site that doesn‚Äôt have much traffic - that‚Äôs definitely mine! I will try setting up a dummy site before making it live, probably using a ‚Äòflat file‚Äô type cms.</description>

      <description>Am a bit shocked to discover I have put on weight over the past year. Not that I am overweight buy any means, but given I am pretty active and have a healthy diet in terms of types of food, I have been quite clearly just eating too much. Having acquired a Garmin fitness watch a year ago and made an effort to maintain and improve my fitness it‚Äôs not so nice to see I have taken a retrograde step.</description>

Got a ‚Äòwelcome back‚Äô email from his headteacher this morning. Just received the ‚Äòschool closure‚Äô one a short while ago. I bet she wrote both at the same time‚Ä¶.</description>

      <description>More fiddling around with the Raspberry pi over the break. Managed to add an SSL certificate to the Nextcloud server using Certbot which has very easy to use instructions on the website. Next on the list is to learn about and implement some Bash scripts and cron jobs so that I can have to pi doing regular back-ups and such.</description>

      <description>Somerset has been moved into tier 4 from today so the few tentative plans to meet with friends have been shelved.
This morning we went to Sainsbury‚Äôs to collect our groceries. It‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôve done click &amp;amp; collect for the food shopping - we get our thrills where we can in our brave new Covid world. Curiously, the arrangement is to rendezvous with a Sainsbury‚Äôs delivery van in a corner of their own car park, as if some shady deal is going down.</description>

      <description>Finished The City &amp;amp; the City by China Mi√©ville.
This first came to my attention via the 2018 mini-series based on it. It‚Äôs as much, if not more, about its ideas as it is about the plot. I will think about it for a long time. Will read again.</description>

      <description>On Sunday I set up a self-hosted Nextcloud server on the Raspberry Pi, using a spare USB flash drive for storage. This tutorial made it a relatively easy process to do, for a non-tech person, although I did make an error along the way that required going through and checking everything a couple of times.
I can now access the files stored on the server from my home network. Next stop, set up remote access.</description>

      <description>Work/eat/sleep and repeat. That‚Äôs what the last two weeks have felt like. It‚Äôs always like this for these darkest weeks of the year. There have been a few sunny days, or part days, but also a lot of murk. Days without form or void.
I don‚Äôt much like driving at this time of year. Dazzling headlights, spray and poor visibility make it hard work. An hour‚Äôs drive in thick fog on Monday was not fun at all.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve got up far too early for a Sunday. For any day, come to that. I decided it would be a good idea to set up the Xbox in advance of Christmas and load a couple of games onto it. Mainly so the process doesn‚Äôt dominate Christmas Day. That way, it can be presented to my son ‚Äòoven ready‚Äô, to use a topical phrase, only in the case of the Xbox, it may actually be true.</description>

      <description>Booted up the Raspberry Pi this afternoon for the first time. Used a redundant monitor, keyboard and mouse. It feels good to repurpose old gear that is sitting around unused. I‚Äôve also set up VNC so I can use my iPad as a monitor.
For the time being I‚Äôve loaded Raspbian and I‚Äôll probably keep it this way for the time being while I get used to using it. However, I‚Äôve no doubt that I will fairly quickly get around to wanting to try some other setups.</description>

      <description>Spending a fair amount of time each day since Tuesday trying to sort out problems with our business email is not my idea of fun. But I think we are there now.
I thought it was a simple case of updating the DNS records. Which was part of the problem. Exacerbated by being given the incorrect information maybe four times? In the end it transpired the DNS records were correct. The problem was, for reasons beyond my comprehension of these things, the hosting company‚Äôs firewall was blocking my IP address.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve just emerged from a JavaScript rabbit hole. I‚Äôve been writing a script that, combined with Shortcuts, will regularly do a backup of a text file. It is probably inelegant, but it works and as a JavaScript newbie I‚Äôm feeling pretty good about it.
This all came about due to my increasing dissatisfaction with Apple and tech in general, or more specifically, the business model that much of tech is based on, namely built-in obsolescence and the lack of control over individual‚Äôs data.</description>

      <description>In light of recent events across the pond, it has been good to experience the feeling that not everything is wrong with the world. Not that everything is right, not by a long shot. But to be reminded of what it used to feel like, to have hope, to believe in our future.</description>

      <description>Had a long chat with the Aged Parents about their moving plans and contrary to my concerns they seem to be taking a more realistic and pragmatic approach to things. It‚Äôs strange, edging closer to being a carer, not that they need ‚Äòcare‚Äô as such yet, but greater involvement is going to become the norm.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs the weekend and I can have a lie in. This last week was supposed to be straightforward but haha, not so.
Thursday afternoon, I had an unexpected change to my day which threw the good old anxiety into overdrive. The first time in a while that I have had such a big reaction and it left me exhausted. It all ran over into Friday where every small thing seemed imbued with far greater stress and significance than was really the case.</description>

      <description>Last night, the Tories voted down Labour‚Äôs motion to extend free school meals during the holidays to disadvantaged children. My son enjoys maths so this morning we did a rough calculation to find out the cost to the Treasury of the scheme, had it been voted through.
According to this article in the Guardian, it would affect 1.4 million children. The vouchers are worth ¬£15 per week, and there are four weeks holiday between now and Easter, which is when it was proposed the scheme would run until.</description>

      <description>Had a problem with the contact form on our business‚Äôs website. Loads of spam plus genuine contacts were being labelled as spam too. In looking to solve this I considered using Captcha. In reading about it I discovered it‚Äôs a Google thing and, unsurprisingly, collects a lot of data.
So I won‚Äôt be installing that then.</description>

      <description>One morning this last week I stepped outside at first light. It was very still and quiet. My attention was drawn to the sound of redwings overhead. The first I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this autumn. Just a few small flocks but a sure sign of the turning of the seasons. Later on the same day I saw a handful of swallows. Another remnant of summer. Two species who‚Äôs combined migratory range extends from Siberia to South Africa.</description>

      <description>Back in April I said I‚Äôd write about my experience with CBT. And I have tried many times to do so. The Summer of Weirdness has made it very difficult to find the headspace to reflect on anything, let alone something as intense as therapy. I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs just too much to try and go back and unpick my thoughts in detail about it, but for what it‚Äôs worth, here‚Äôs a brief summary.</description>

      <description>One of the reasons I switched to a Wordpress site for my blog was to use the IndieWeb plugin, in particular to enable webmentions. It takes a little more work to implement than a straightforward post but I like being able to do so. The ethos of the IndieWeb has a lot of appeal. Only thing is, I haven‚Äôt used them as much as I could.
I have saved links to numerous posts I that I‚Äôve come across on other people‚Äôs blogs, with the intention of referencing them in my own posts via webmentions.</description>

      <description>In the first four days of October we have had two‚Äìthree times the rainfall that we had throughout the whole of September.
Over the past week we have had the first frost, first evening with the wood burner lit, and the first mornings with the heating on. A small flock of mistle thrushes was in the chestnut tree in the church yard next door - we occasionally see a pair around here, but to see a flock can only mean they are winter migrants from the continent.</description>

      <description>Started to feel a bit unwell yesterday. Had a high temperature this morning so after checking the NHS website realised I had to go and get a Covid test. Our nearest site was just 40 mins away and meant a very pleasant drive in the autumn sunshine. Had to do the test myself which wasn‚Äôt awful, but not very nice either. Just got to self-isolate now, at least until we get the result back.</description>

      <description>Linking notes in an organised fashion along the lines of a zettelkasten is an idea that appeals, as I make notes and save things to read later all the time. I could do this in Drafts but like Bear notes, another option, the notes are saved in iCloud, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think they are in plaintext or other easy to migrate format. I think it was via¬†Neil Mather¬†that I came across¬†TiddlyWiki.</description>

      <description>If I‚Äôm honest, I have to admit that part of the reason I will listen to so many podcasts is so I don‚Äôt have to listen to the stream of negative horseshit that my mind seems to produce if left to its own devices. Something to work on there, methinks.

      <description>The swallows have definitely left now, the odd straggler around, possibly the late brood feeding up before leaving. Heard a Little owl during the night, the first I‚Äôve heard this autumn. Various warblers on the move as well: willow warblers, chiffchaffs, and blackcaps.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm kind of done with Apple. In the sense of being loyal to the ecosystem. I‚Äôve always had a slight reluctance to go all in with their native apps anyway. What if I want to move to a different system at a later date?
Migrating information out of Apple always looks less than ideal. Hence, for example, I like to use a plain text file system for notes, stored in Dropbox, rather than the native Notes app.</description>

      <description>Off to see Mum today. Up early, away by 7am. An easy drive and beautiful light. Gold and blue. A skein of geese passing over the motorway.
A much needed conversation. In a good way. Dad‚Äôs health, mind and moving forward. Concerns laid bare. Mum feeling looked after.
Practicalities. Sorted a problem with their phone.
Then back home. A different route to avoid the holiday traffic.
Exhausted. But worth it.</description>

      <description>My siblings and I have been using Signal for group chats of late, often about the aged parents. Over the last few days the topic of Dad‚Äôs cognitive state has been top of the list, wondering if there is confusion and such starting to show. A few days ago my brother reported a conversation that was markedly scrambled.
For the Bank Holiday weekend we had planned something relaxing. A slow Saturday, meeting up with friends tomorrow, and maybe a day of catching up on some jobs on Monday.</description>

      <description>Day off today, so we got up early and hoofed it off to Exmoor. Arrived in the fog, cooked up pancakes and then went for a walk in the belated sunshine. Paddled in a stream, cooked up lunch, sat around enjoying the warmth and then wandered home. Feel better for that.</description>

      <description>Am working my way through the back catalogue of The Hilarious World of Depression podcast.
It‚Äôs funny, moving and encouraging. Occasionally, someone says something which really nails it in some way.
John Moe, the host, on moving to a place of recognition and healing;
‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a sadness, I think, that comes with feeling healthier, mentally. You uncover some truths, you accept them. And that lets you stop doing all the frantic things you‚Äôve been doing for so many years to run from the problems in your mind, the facades you‚Äôve been putting up.</description>

      <description>Was awake in the night due to the heat. Heard a curious sound outside. A repeated wheezing call. A bit of research and discovered it was the begging call of juvenile tawny owls. I think there must have been two of them. Good to know ‚Äòour‚Äô tawny‚Äôs have successfully reared young this year.</description>

      <description>In regard to taking meds, I‚Äôd like to run a control version of myself in parallel so that I can identify what and if the meds are doing anything useful.
I make notes about effects that I attribute to them. I then read the notes later and wonder if they actually have anything to do with the meds at all.</description>

      <description>Apart from a bit of lightning in the distance last night, am most disappointed to have missed out on the thunderstorms overnight. There is still thundery cloud about this morning, so maybe we‚Äôll be in luck today, however, it‚Äôs quite a bit cooler so the chance may have passed.</description>

      <description>Read Dissolution by C J Sansom. Already familiar with the story from the BBC radio adaptation, although it‚Äôs long enough ago that I listened to it to have forgotten who it was what dunnit.
Set during the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, it‚Äôs a conventional but enjoyable and pacy historical murder mystery. Greed, lust, power, class and pond drainage. Somewhat in the vein of Ellis Peters&amp;rsquo; Cadfael¬†series but with more bodily fluids.</description>

      <description>üé• As part of our Disney+ summer binge, we watched Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones  last night. I had not seen it before, not being a dyed-in-the-wool Star Wars fan, but we are working our way through the whole series.
Well, I knew it got some bad reviews and I can see why. I am not going to waste my breath on what I thought was wrong with it other than to say it felt like a lot longer than the 2+ hours running time.</description>

      <description>Have been finding it difficult to write anything of a personal nature at the moment. A few days ago I started writing about how, since the start of the lockdown, I have finally reached a kind of equilibrium. Adaptation to the new normal, at least, the current new normal.
It almost feels like emotional numbness. Maybe it is. While here in the SW we have experienced little of Covid itself, living with the lockdown measures has been a strain, as it has for everyone else.</description>

      <description>After nearly deleting Omnifocus, I paid for a month‚Äôs subscription and have been giving some more time to it. But I have also been using Things 3. I bought this for my iPad quite a while ago and enjoyed using it other than it being very date focussed, which doesn‚Äôt really suit my style. In addition it doesn‚Äôt have an equivalent of perspectives in Omnifocus.
However, since I last used Things, a comprehensive URL scheme has been implemented and this is a game changer, enabling the creation of Shortcuts in IOS that emulate perspectives pretty well.</description>

      <description>Just managed to get a peep at comet Neowise. The sky is still rather light in the NE but Neowise looked good through the binoculars. What is more impressive is Jupiter to the SE. Very bright and visible as a disc through the binoculars and 4 of its moons very clear as well. Blows the mind.</description>

      <description>Further to my plans to fit new brakes on my bike, I ordered some that were suitable, which duly arrived a week or so ago. All good to go.
Only I had not paid attention to the existing brake levers, the ones that are quite literally in front of me when I‚Äôm riding. They are combined brake levers/gear shifters‚Ä¶.
Why I‚Äôd not thought of that before ordering the new ones, I‚Äôm not sure.</description>

      <description>I have been messing around with OmniFocus. Again.
I tried it maybe a couple of years ago, but couldn‚Äôt quite justify committing to it. I think I might be heading the same way again.
I love the perspectives. And the organisation of projects.
But the lack of quick entry of tasks, a la Fantastical or Todoist is probably a deal breaker. And then I discovered that deferred tasks no longer show up in the Forecast view if the start date passes.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve just come out of a particularly long rabbit hole. Have spent the last 10 days or so obsessively learning more about automation and scripting in the context of task managers, URL schemes, Drafts and Shortcuts.
One of those occasions where the enjoyment of discovery meant other things didn‚Äôt get my attention, like reading and blogging.
I think my efforts have paid off. I have to get on now and use what I‚Äôve learnt and not just continue trying out more ideas.</description>

      <description>The other day, our old boy bumped into a lamp post. His vision is not so good now, as he has cataracts. Along with prodigious eyebrows, as is befitting a dog of his breed and age.
I have a theory that the cataracts diffuse direct sunlight, such that it blurs his vision beyond that which the cataracts do. I once mentioned this to a human who had cataracts (but not prodigious eyebrows) and she bore out my theory.</description>

My son and I have been cycling more of late. He is on a bigger bike now and is far more capable so that opens up many new possibilities.
I bought my bike secondhand some years ago. It‚Äôs a mish-mash of components, some good, some not so good.</description>

      <description>Blogging for me is a way to process thoughts. This is mostly an in-out system. Stuff happens, I think about it, I write.
Not everything ends up on the blog. Many sentences jotted down go no further. But things that need working out in more depth will probably end up as a post.
For the last week though, I‚Äôve been in a log-jam. Too much to process.
Statues, protests, police violence, BLM, climate change, coronavirus, those that have, those that don‚Äôt, will a relation need cancer treatment, no school until September, how will we manage that, how are my elderly parents really doing, what kind of world is my son growing up in, the van needs a service, I‚Äôd like more sleep.</description>

      <description>Last year, I was voraciously reading forum posts and articles relating to mental illness. It was the early days after my wake up call and I was trying to learn as much as I could. From time to time I would come across someone voicing the question ‚ÄòWhere do I end and my mental illness begin?‚Äô
It was reassuring to see others express this as it reflected what was going through my mind.</description>

      <description>Flexibits have removed the annoying pop-up prompts to sign up for the premium version of Fantastical on iOS. It is now much more pleasant to use again. The natural language input is just brilliant and being able to use actions in Drafts for setting up events makes for a really useful workflow.
I am still yet to be convinced that the premium version is worth it, much as I would like to have access to Fantastical on the Mac.</description>

I am at much the same place as you Colin, and it _feels¬†_like this is a moment in life in which to re-evaluate, an opportunity not to be missed. But as to what to change, and how, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I hope you find your way&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Facebook Says Very Little on Privacy of Messenger Rooms
Those policies, and the few specifics Facebook has given publicly about Messenger Rooms, leave unanswered important questions about how the company handles the metadata around video calls‚Ä¶ No surprises there, then.
The Facebook ‚Äúdata policy,‚Äù which the company spokesperson repeatedly pointed me to as the firm‚Äôs canonical document for questions of information collection, is mostly built from vastly generalized statements (‚ÄúWe collect information about how you use our Products‚Äù) punctuated by slightly narrowed examples (‚Äúsuch as the types of content you view or engage with‚Äù).</description>

      <description>Changed our business email hosting provider over the weekend. A fairly straightforward process other than changing the MX records. Used the live chat support to find out what they need to be changed to. It took nearly an hour for them to do it.
Maybe there was a genuine reason for why it took so long but anyway. Got it sorted eventually. And the new system is a lot easier to manage.</description>

      <description>Thoughts have not come easily for the last few days. A flatness in my mind, probably induced in part by a lack of sleep, which in turn is brought on by the short nights and hayfever.
Having finally developed a sense of stability around The Situation for the moment, a kind of ennui has settled in. Not a frame of mind I particularly go for.
This is neither thoroughly unpleasant nor very enjoyable.</description>

      <description>Naomi Klein, writing about how big tech plans to profit from the pandemic,¬†acknowledges that:
technology is most certainly a key part of how we must protect public health in the coming months and years. However, she goes on to ask these vital questions about our relationship with tech:
..will that technology be subject to the disciplines of democracy and public oversight, or will it be rolled out in state-of-exception frenzy, without asking critical questions that will shape our lives for decades to come?</description>

      <description>A family walk this morning. Took a trip out to the Somerset Levels, now that we are allowed to travel a bit more.
Lots of birds - but no cuckoos. Swifts, sedge warblers, curlews, reed buntings, skylarks, egrets and swans.
Meadows looking lovely. Lots of flowers including orchids (Southern Marsh?).
Drama in the garden when we returned. Birds giving alarm calls - turned out a great spotted woodpecker was having a crack at the box where the great tits are nesting.</description>

      <description>Came across this research paper¬†on social anxiety disorder and one sentence stood out, as it sheds some light on the unresolved question of how can it take so long to realise there is something going on:
Owing to the early onset and chronicity of SAD, many individuals may also believe that these symptoms are part of their personality and therefore cannot be changed. Makes me feel better.</description>

      <description>Some apprehension today, as I am expecting it to be busier out and about, on the back of the government‚Äôs announcement encouraging a return to work.
I hope, I really do, that people will be considerate and make the effort to social distance themselves in busier places, with more of us around. Most people are considerate, but I‚Äôve seen enough of the small number who aren‚Äôt to think it a legitimate concern.</description>

      <description>For a bird with a reputation for being secretive, jays make an almighty racket when the occasion calls for it.
Yesterday, a walk in the woods. A jay kicks off in the trees above me. Spotted movement amongst the branches. There it was, getting in the face of a tawny owl. It would fly onto the branch next to the owl, squawk in its face and fly off again. Meanwhile, she would give a little ‚Äòtu-whit‚Äô in response.</description>

      <description>A while back Colin Walker commented on a post of mine:
Mental health awareness has come on in leaps and bounds recently but, for many, that‚Äôs still all it is: an awareness. We need to convert that into an understanding.  Fortunately, we are more aware of mental health issues today, certainly compared to how it was when I was growing up. Prior to facing up to my own issues I considered that I had a basic appreciation of what having a mental illness meant.</description>

      <description>International Dawn Chorus Day
Got out into the garden this morning to listen to the dawn chorus, and made these two recordings. Stereo recording, best listened to with headphones for full immersion.
First one at 5:15am, mainly blackbirds and robins. It started to rain as I recorded so you can hear that too.

Second recording, made at 6:00am and the sound profile has changed - many more species.</description>

      <description>Here in the UK, the guidance on what constitutes a reasonable excuse to leave the house includes ‚Äòdriving to countryside and walking (where far more time is spent walking than driving)‚Äô. We took this at face value yesterday and drove to a local spot for a 3 mile walk in woodland. It was a lovely day and we enjoyed bluebells and the fresh green of new beech leaves. There were a few other walkers about but everyone was considerate and sensible.</description>

      <description>It is a year ago today since I first recognised something of what was going on with my mental health. It has been a long 12 months, going through various states of mind as I have tried to come to terms with it all.
I haven‚Äôt posted much on the subject of late, largely because I have been receiving CBT since January and it is prettty intense. I have now finished the course except for a couple of follow up sessions and it seems a good time to reflect on both the therapy and the last year.</description>

      <description>Have intended to give sourdough a go for a little while now, so with it being the Thing To Do while we are hunkered down in our vaults, I decided now was the time. Got some great advice from Jeremy Cherfas over at Micro.blog on getting a starter going, so thanks to him.
Started one last weekend and then this weekend made my first loaf. Really quite pleased with it. More dense than I hoped but was even textured and tasted delicious.</description>

      <description>About 20 years ago, we went travelling in Canada, and part of our time was spent driving across the prairie in Alberta and Saskatchewan. It is a fascinating landscape and so very different from ours here in the UK. It was also a disconcerting experience, and much as I enjoyed it I also found it oppressive. I put this down to the geography. In the UK you always know more or less where you are.</description>

      <description>Tonight I ventured to the supermarket. Two items of note;
 * my wife wrote a shopping list which included 1 block of strength 3 Cheddar cheese, 1 block of strength 4. I misread it and bought 3 blocks and 4 blocks respectively. So inadvertently I have now stockpiled cheese‚Ä¶. * while waiting at the checkout a customer gave the young woman working the till a bunch of flowers, at which she promptly burst into tears.</description>

      <description>Watched Bumblebee with the family yesterday. I have zero investment in the Transformers world but thought it very enjoyable. My 10yr old gave it a big thumbs up. Really liked the &amp;lsquo;80s milieu and cultural references. Good to see a female protagonist and thought the CGI was good - the robots had solidity and weight to them. A fun family action film with a lot of heart.</description>

      <description>The blue tits that are using the nest box in our garden are getting much busier. Nest building is very much underway as can be seen in the picture below. I built and installed the box last year, and what they don‚Äôt know is that it has a hinged roof, so I can take a peek inside. This is not just from idle curiosity but so that I can record the nest activity for the BTO Nest Record Scheme.</description>

      <description>As any parent will know, boundaries are there for children to test. And for my 10 year old, that means the physical boundaries - of our garden. Footballs, rugby balls, cricket balls, a space hopper (remember those? Yes, we have one). They all make frequent trips over the fence into our neighbours garden or the field. My 10 year old&amp;rsquo;s power output currently far outstrips his accuracy and control.
Much as it frustrates me at times when I have to go and find a ball for the umpteenth time, I have to remind myself that this testing of the boundaries will stand him in good stead later in life.</description>

      <description>Some positives from the last week or so&amp;hellip;
For the second time in a week I have seen a peregrine falcon. This one was circling about a hundred metres above me - the heavier build was a give away, distinguishing it from our other falcons and hawks. The white on its face catching the sun as it wheeled, it climbed higher and higher without so much as a flap of the wings.</description>

      <description>In order to stay positive, I am trying to limit my intake of news. I want facts, not sensation. Even some of the output from those sources I deem to be more measured have arguably strayed into the unnecessary at times.
I also find decent analysis useful to listen to as well. I have recently subscribed to the podcast Outrage and Optimism. One of the hosts is Christiana Figueres, who led the work at the UN that resulted in the Paris Agreement.</description>

      <description>I wanted to read an adventure/mystery novel that was not in the usual thriller or crime genres that I tend to read when I am in the mood for a good yarn. Picked on ‚ÄéLabyrinth by Kate Mosse, based on having heard of her and aware her books are popular. Big mistake - what should have been an intriguing mystery was let down by two-dimensional characters and pretty dull writing. I had hoped for an enjoyable if undemanding page turner, but it was not to be.</description>

      <description>The mad thing is, now that we have all become hunter-gatherers again, my wife and I are going into shops more than we ever normally would. While we are not completely out of staple goods, we are finding it nigh on impossible to restock them.
Our village farm shop are being brilliant at supplying fresh produce and dairy goods. And we are still getting our weekly veg box. Presumably the panic-buyers will at some point run out of space in which to stockpile?</description>

      <description>Re struggling to write, the paradox is that it is at times like the last week or so when I want to write more. There is so much going on, so much to assimilate and adapt to, and yet actually distilling the jumble of thoughts and reactions is hard.</description>

      <description>I have found it hard to write this week. Anxiety, tiredness and addressing the banal have consumed any time or energy that I might otherwise have had to write. Thoughts have passed through my head and some I have even jotted down, but putting them together into something coherent has felt beyond my reach.
The beginning of the week was not easy. My wife and I are both self-employed and what with a lack of financial help from the government and the start of the lockdown, to say my anxiety went through the roof is not an overstatement.</description>

      <description>Heard my first Blackcaps of the year singing over the last couple of days. Still no swallows - with any luck they‚Äôll turn up over the weekend. Bluetits still busy in the birdbox - don‚Äôt think they are building yet, a bit early. The robins seem to have been ousted from their nest box by a wren. They built their nest but a few days ago I realised that a wren was coming and going.</description>

      <description>I and a friend were recently trying out Signal as a secure cross-platform messaging app, something to use for group chats where not everyone is using iMessage. I had heard good things about it and this was largely born out in our trial. And yet‚Ä¶
Given that it is privacy conscious people who likely to be drawn to it, why does Signal insist on notifying other users who have you in their contacts list that you have joined and vice versa?</description>

      <description>The weekend has arrived not a moment too soon. While there are a some practicalities to sort out I feel that some serious downtime is needed after a pretty draining week.
I am going to keep my news intake to the bare minimum. Go for a run. Maybe two. Watch a film. Read. Perhaps even a bit of gaming. Get out into the garden. And any of this could be on my own or with my family.</description>

      <description>The number of people in our village who have offered to run errands is impressive. It‚Äôs really heartening to see. So we have some offering to shop for groceries, or go to the Post Office, someone who works in the local pharmacy who can collect and deliver prescriptions and the local farm shop are going to prepare frozen meals for those that need them. Good to see such community spirit!</description>

      <description>On further reflection it is probably for the best that we can‚Äôt get grocery deliveries online, as we are able to go out and hopefully it is those who need to self-isolate who are booking up the delivery slots. However, the cynic in me suspects that is not the case.
A business just down the road that supplies pubs and restaurants expects to last no more than a week, now that demand has disappeared.</description>

      <description>So far the Coronavirus has had little impact on us here in the south west of the UK. Schools are still open for the time being and we are largely able to work without making too many adjustments (so far).
What has become apparent just today is the effect of panic buying. We get our groceries delivered and on the back of a chance remark from someone we checked on the availability of delivery slots.</description>

      <description>Our Victoria plum tree is covered in buds so am hoping for a good crop this year. Yesterday I spotted a pigeon happily devouring them so shooed it away. Last year we didn‚Äôt get a single fruit for the same reason. I‚Äôm glad I saw the pigeon as it prompted me to get some netting over said tree in order to prevent further loss of blossom. Me - 1, pigeons - 0.</description>

      <description>The birds are getting very busy in our garden. All three nest boxes have had attention of some sort.
A pair of robins are nesting in one while a pair of blue tits seem very interested in another, spending a lot of time checking it out. The final box has been visited by great tits although I‚Äôm not confident yet that they will use it.
And the song thrush still sings on every morning.</description>

Since then, I am really pleased to have heard from two other people who have seen it, including being spotted hunting in a field not far from us. This is exactly what I have been hoping for - that it was finding prey in some of the rough grazing pasture around us.
As the evenings lengthen I hope to be able to get out around dusk and watch for it.</description>

      <description>Woke in the night to the sound of wind lashing rain against the window - I don‚Äôt think I have ever heard it quite so loud before. Got up this morning to find the rain has moved through and the gales have subsided. Quite the contrast.
I have been trying to bring some sort of meditation/mindfulness practice into my daily routine, but lately I have let it slip. Work, CBT and some minor medical issues have been tiring.</description>

      <description>Having moved my blog to Wordpress, the first task was to choose an IndieWeb-friendly theme. Over at IndieWeb.org there is advice aplenty on what themes work well - I won‚Äôt pretend to understand it all yet. I have used Autonomie by Matthias Pfefferle. I like it‚Äôs minimalist look - no doubt some tinkering will occur.
The second task was to find a way to easily post to the blog without involving the ghastly Wordpress app.</description>

      <description>When I decided to write¬†about my experience with mental illness I didn‚Äôt really have in mind how much or how often I would share my thoughts. It was a case of have a go and see where it led. What I definitely hadn‚Äôt given consideration to was what, and if, to write when I am not feeling so great.
Part of the exercise was about being honest about the experience, and it goes without saying that a big part of most mental illness is not feeling too good about yourself.</description>

      <description>One reason I enjoy this time of year is the way bird song gathers pace. It is a long lead in before it might be called the dawn chorus, although when exactly that starts is a moot point. In my mind it is when Blackbirds start singing in numbers. Great tits are one of the earliest to start - often within the first two weeks of the year I will hear the joyous monotony of their song.</description>

      <description>Session three of my CBT course this week. I was recommended for what they call High Intensity CBT and intense it most certainly is. For someone who‚Äôs sleep is not the best, this is one way to get a solid night‚Äôs rest. When I received confirmation of the course, I knew it would be demanding, and I also knew that I didn‚Äôt really know just how demanding. I just hope I have the wherewithal to see it to its conclusion and come away with some tools to help improve my mental health.</description>

      <description>üèè Another good win for England making it 2-1 for the series in SA. Some very good stuff coming from England in this game. A century each for Stokes &amp;amp; Pope, a fivefer for Bess, and 4 wkts for Root - I hear he‚Äôs also not bad with the bat.</description>

      <description>For the last 2 years or so I have been involved in conducting wetland bird surveys on the Somerset Levels. I have taken a break from it for a few months, while I get my head around the mental health issues I&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with. Today however, I got back to it as I have been feeling ready to do so. Counts take place once a month on specified dates to enable coordination and today&amp;rsquo;s is the most important of the year as it coincides with the International Waterbird Census.</description>

      <description>On Monday I will have my first Cognitive Behavioural Therapy appointment. When I was referred back in August I was told it was a six month waiting list - such is the NHS.
What I didn‚Äôt realise at the time was how lucky I am to have access to this therapy at all. Talking with a friend a couple of months ago, I learnt that they had no access to NHS Talking Therapies simply because of the NHS Trust they come under.</description>

      <description>8am today, a Song thrush was singing from a tree just beyond our garden. Not its sub-song as might be expected at this time of year, but full song. Fantastic to hear it - felt like a spring morning. A good way to start the New Year. Have a listen - also a Robin singing and a scolding Blue Tit.</description>

      <description>It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been easy to admit that in order to be able to make a return to doing longer walks we will have to leave the dog at home. But it is also a relief to do so. I have missed doing more strenuous walks on a regular basis and am conscious that I am not as fit as I&amp;rsquo;d like to be. The dog still gets his walks, plus gets to sleep by the woodburner while we are off.</description>

      <description>6:30am. I‚Äôve just stepped outside. It‚Äôs perfectly still and clear. No moon, bright stars. A hint of lighter sky in the east. I can hear one or two cars out on the main road and a lone satellite is moving overhead. The wood burner is lit, cups of tea are made. Merry Christmas.</description>

      <description>It has been 8 weeks now that I have been taking antidepressants for my Social Anxiety Disorder. I was initially sceptical about trying them but ultimately concluded that it was worth a shot. Fortunately I got few side effects - nausea for a couple of weeks, and some very vivid and surreal dreams. Of the many possible side effects listed I note one is that you might feel ‚Äòtoo happy‚Äô!</description>

      <description>At the weekend we watched Arrival. It has been on my list of films to see and happened to be on TV. A really thought provoking film and for me the kind of storytelling when sci-fi is at its best. I will now have to read the novella it is based on - Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang.
Funnily, I was thinking about Bladerunner 2049 - another of Denis Villeneuve&amp;rsquo;s films, after reading Colin Walker‚Äôs post about watching it on his phone.</description>

      <description>I mentioned a few days ago that I was trying out a note-taking/markdown app called Joplin. I had not heard of it before, but I had read a short review of it and thought it sounded worth a go.
So far I like it. The UI of both the iPhone and Mac apps could do with some polish but are elegant enough. Not pretty but get the job done.
What I do like is the following;</description>

      <description>Part of me doesn‚Äôt want to post this. Shame can be a powerful aspect to mental illness but I have found reading about other people‚Äôs experiences so meaningful I feel compelled to share my own.
Earlier this year I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. Or SAD for short.
I had never heard of the condition until this year but it is one of the most common anxiety disorders. I have struggled with depressive episodes and anxiety since my teens but have never been able to quite put a finger on what the problem was.</description>

      <description>In my endless search for the ultimate note-taking/writing app, I have been using Simplenote for a couple of months. Just found that on the iPhone there is a problem selecting text - when I try to drag the handles they disappear.

      <description>Am involved with looking after our community woodland. Yesterday, went to look at a piece of woodland left to the local parish council in someone‚Äôs will. The wood is only about 20 years old, but some older trees exist along the boundaries. Found this Hornbeam, a tree I rarely see as such a large specimen. I wouldn‚Äôt like to guess it‚Äôs age but so nice to see one this large.</description>

I don‚Äôt know quite yet how I will go about this, but my intention is to use blogging as a way of exploring my experiences and to chart my progress. The internet can be a toxic place, but it is also where I found valuable information on the issues I am dealing with.</description>

      <description>Enjoyed episode 2 of His Dark Materials. Read the trilogy about 10 years ago and I can‚Äôt recall all the plot details so it feels quite fresh. I see next weeks‚Äô episode is followed by a new production of H. G. Wells‚Äô War of the Worlds. That‚Äôs my Sunday night viewing sorted then. üì∫</description>

      <description>Part of my morning routine is to take our dog out for a short walk. Being an old boy with arthritis and failing eyesight, he likes to take his time, sniffing his way around the route. It‚Äôs supposed to be a chance for me to look around, take a moment before heading to work. Often though, preoccupation with the day ahead means my mind is elsewhere. Today was the first sunny morning in a while, and finally the trees are showing some good autumn colour.</description>

      <description>Before using Micro.blog¬†I had a blog on Wordpress.com. In fact, I‚Äôve had more than one - all started with good intentions, but each has run aground. One reason is Wordpress itself. It is so feature rich that it would get in the way of what blogging is about - writing. And I‚Äôm not talking about being distracted by features.
I found using both the Wordpress app and website at best slow and clunky, at worst prone to freezing and crashing.</description>

      <description>I am apt to wake far too early - sometimes an hour or more before I need to. During the summer I don‚Äôt mind too much but now the mornings are dark it‚Äôs not so easy. I am far too prone to start worrying about things, so I am trying out listening to music or meditation audio. It helps - the only thing is by the time I actually have to get up I can be just about ready to nod off again.</description>

      <description>A recent podcast series I have enjoyed is The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. Based on the H.P. Lovecraft novel of the same name, it is given a modern setting and presented in the style of a true crime podcast, neatly sidestepping Lovecraft‚Äôs writing style. Enjoyable hokum.</description>

      <description>The dry summer has lasted well into September. Funnily, it was early in the month that we used the wood burner on a couple of cooler evenings. The rest have been very mild. All change last week, with gales and plenty of much needed rain.
Yesterday we collected conkers. Have no use for them. Just like to look at them, enjoy the feel of them in the hand.</description>

      <description>Leaving for work on Monday morning, a flat tyre. A wheel change, a trip to the tyre shop, half the morning gone, original plans scuppered, how best to use the rest of the day. Usually this leaves me feeling frustrated, stressed, guilty even. Not quite in control and my day wasted.
As it was I was able to catch up on some outstanding tasks; email clients, planning, that sort of thing.</description>

      <description>Among the dramas playing out in the current Ashes series, one thing is beginning to emerge - in Rory Burns, England may have found themselves a true opener with the right temperament.

      <description>I have long thought that journaling is a great idea, but it has never really worked out for me. There are various reasons for this;
 With a traditional paper diary with pre-dated pages there is pressure to fill that space. And if I lack inspiration it is easy to give up. I have tended to think that ideas should be fully formed before committing them to record. This is an approach guaranteed to fail - who ever has a new idea or train of thought that is fully formed the moment it occurs?</description>

      <description>Watched Midnight Special last night. It didn‚Äôt draw me in as much as I would have liked, but equally I appreciated the light touch with which the plot was handled - no excessive exposition, thank goodness.</description>

      <description>Cup and ring marks on the Roughting Linn stone, Northumberland. They are between 3500 and 6000 years old.  The rock, roughly 20m x 5m, is hidden away in woodland. An ancient place.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog. I have started various blogs over the years, most of which have fizzled out for one reason or another. I like the discipline of writing - I think it is good for my brain.
Probably the main reason that I have not managed to keep blogging in the past is because most of the ones I have started are on a single topic. Because I tend to dabble in one thing, move on to something else, and then come back, I often found I lost momentum.</description>
