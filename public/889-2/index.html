      <p>Have been finding it difficult to write anything of a personal nature at the moment. A few days ago I started writing about how, since the start of the lockdown, I have finally reached a kind of equilibrium. Adaptation to the new normal, at least, the current new normal.</p>

<p>It almost feels like emotional numbness. Maybe it is. While here in the SW we have experienced little of Covid itself, living with the lockdown measures has been a strain, as it has for everyone else.</p>

<p>While I was able to continue working and so maintain something of the old normal, seeing my family dealing with much greater restriction was hard to do. Wished I could have done something to ease the difficulty of it.</p>

<p>At the moment I have an appetite for stories. Am listening and watching and reading in far greater quantities than usual. I’m sure this is a reaction to everything that has gone on. Think I have read somewhere that this is a Thing.</p>

<p>Living a socially paired down existence means there is less pressure to deal with the social anxiety. This is not such a good thing, as what momentum I had gained through doing the CBT has somewhat stalled.</p>

<p>Maybe I shouldn’t be to hard on myself. Maybe accept that right now is a time to take a breather and recharge. Enjoy time with my family. Enjoy the stories.</p>
