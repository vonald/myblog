The local authority here in Somerset have taken the highly unusual step to close schools across the county today, in anticipation of the storm. 

I can't help wondering if this is a tad excessive, but equally I am neither a meteorologist or fortune-teller so what do I know. And of course the safety of my son and all the other children comes first.

So, we will all be here at home today, either working or studying. 

We may require cake.
