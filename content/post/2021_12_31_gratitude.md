2021 has made me think all over again about what we are doing to this planet. And ourselves. About what really matters. I like this quote from Donald Robertson's [How to think like a Roman Emperor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39863499-how-to-think-like-a-roman-emperor?): 

> '...to desire something is to imagine having what you don’t have, the presence of something that’s absent. Gratitude, on the other hand, comes from imagining the absence of things that are currently present: What would it be like if you didn’t have this? If we don’t occasionally picture loss, reminding ourselves what life might be like without the things and people we love, we would take them for granted."

If this is the only thing that sticks in my sieve-like mind over the coming year, I'll take it.
