![Went for a short family walk that turned into a respectable 6k.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7qna1bxydteemfc/IMG_3442.jpeg?raw=1)
Went for a short family walk on the Wiltshire Downs that turned into a respectable 6k. Wildflowers and birds and a big sky. Skylark, whitethroat, blackcap, yellow hammer, corn bunting and willow warbler.

Took this photo from a long barrow. And according to the map, crossed a Roman road. History beneath our feet.
