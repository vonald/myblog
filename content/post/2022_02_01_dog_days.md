A trip to the vet for our dog today. Just for a check up and to issue a prescription for diazepam to sedate him post-seizure, as and when any further ones occur. 

Interestingly, the vet said that because he doesn't exhibit any behavioural changes between seizures, it is unlikely to be a brain tumour, after all. More likely, the first seizure/stroke caused some damage that is triggering the subsequent seizures.She also said he is quite happy, no sign of depression, neither is he in any pain. 

So we continue, a day at a time.
