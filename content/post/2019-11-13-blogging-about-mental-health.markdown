I didn’t expect to be dealing with mental health issues in my forties. But nor has it been a complete surprise either. 

I don’t know quite yet how I will go about this, but my intention is to use blogging as a way of exploring my experiences and to chart my progress. The internet can be a toxic place, but it is also where I found valuable information on the issues I am dealing with. As well as seeing my doctor and reading books and articles, it is through reading and hearing about other people’s experiences that I am encouraged to work towards some sort of recovery. 

I am normally a very private person, but as well as blogging for my own benefit if anyone stumbles across my corner of the internet and finds it helpful, well that’s my way of giving back. I have created a post category for Mental Health so what I write on the topic can be accessed [here](https://www.strandlines.blog/categories/mental-health/).
