ðŸŽ¥ As part of our Disney+ summer binge, we watched [Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones ](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/) last night. I had not seen it before, not being a dyed-in-the-wool Star Wars fan, but we are working our way through the whole series.

Well, I knew it got some bad reviews and I can see why. I am not going to waste my breath on what I thought was wrong with it other than to say it felt like a lot longer than the 2+ hours running time. But in the completionist interest of the exercise I am glad we got that one ticked off early on.
