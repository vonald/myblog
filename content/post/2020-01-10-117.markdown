On Monday I will have my first Cognitive Behavioural Therapy appointment. When I was referred back in August I was told it was a six month waiting list - such is the NHS.

What I didnâ€™t realise at the time was how lucky I am to have access to this therapy at all. Talking with a friend a couple of months ago, I learnt that they had no access to NHS Talking Therapies simply because of the NHS Trust they come under. So I am grateful that I do.

I am also glad I have got my meds sorted out well in advance of starting the therapy.

Of course, committing to the therapy brings all sorts of anxieties along with it. Will I get on with the therapist? Will I be able to focus? Will the demands of it be something I can step up to? Will there be adequate parking? And so it goes on...
