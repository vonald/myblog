Finished [The City & the City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_&_the_City) by _China Miéville_.

This first came to my attention via the 2018 mini-series based on it. It’s as much, if not more, about its ideas as it is about the plot. I will think about it for a long time. Will read again.
