Looks like [I won't be getting my vaccine until at least May due to a shortage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/17/nhs-covid-vaccine-rollout-under-50s-delayed-major-shortage?). I can't say it overly bothers me as I am low risk and I'm certainly not going to burden myself with trying to get my head around what politicians are saying or not saying about what is behind the shortage.
