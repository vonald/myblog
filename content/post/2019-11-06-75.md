Part of my morning routine is to take our dog out for a short walk. Being an old boy with arthritis and failing eyesight, he likes to take his time, sniffing his way around the route. Itâ€™s supposed to be a chance for me to look around, take a moment before heading to work. Often though, preoccupation with the day ahead means my mind is elsewhere. Today was the first sunny morning in a while, and finally the trees are showing some good autumn colour. The light was beautiful. It was a reminder that I really should make the effort to stop, take it all in and enjoy the moment.
