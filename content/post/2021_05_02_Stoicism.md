Finished reading Donald J Robertson's [Stoicism and the Art of Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17841317-stoicism-and-the-art-of-happiness). A pretty easy read and good introduction to modern Stoicism. If I had to give it one criticism I'd say it is a tad repetitive, I would imagine partly because it's part of a Teach Yourself series. I will probably read it through again in a bit more detail in due course.

Delving into Stoicism, I'd not realised at all that it has experienced a resurgence in the last few years. Which I'm glad about because given I have a pretty contrary nature, I will often shy away from something if it's currently a 'thing'. The impression I get is, like anything that gets into the public imagination, it has attracted the genuinely inquisitive, but also bandwagoners. It also has its critics and I'm very happy to read well-reasoned arguments pointing out its flaws as I wouldn't want to accept an idea without looking at it from all angles. And I'd rather read something of that nature than articles of the cringe-inducing ['mind hack'](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/stoicism-ancient-mind-hack/) variety. 

Stoicism has a lot going for it but also many questions. Which is fine.
