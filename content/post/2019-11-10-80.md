Enjoyed episode 2 of [His Dark Materials](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m000b1v2/his-dark-materials). Read the trilogy about 10 years ago and I canâ€™t recall all the plot details so it feels quite fresh. I see next weeksâ€™ episode is followed by a new production of H. G. Wellsâ€™ [War of the Worlds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bj11). Thatâ€™s my Sunday night viewing sorted then. ðŸ“º
