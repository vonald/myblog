Normally, when I buy fuel, I always completely fill the tank. No point in doing less as it means more frequent stops. Inefficient.

But with fuel prices what they are I made an exception last week, and just partly filled up as I was running low. I paid Â£183.90 for diesel, which seems unbelievable. 

I've loaded an app onto my phone that shows fuel prices at filling stations on a map. So I'm hoping that next time I can find somewhere a little cheaper. 

Interesting times.
