The lockdown has given us a pretty unique perspective on what is important and what is not, particularly in terms of how we spend our time.

I am at much the same place as you Colin, and it _feelsÂ _like this is a moment in life in which to re-evaluate, an opportunity not to be missed. But as to what to change, and how, I don't know. I hope you find your way...
