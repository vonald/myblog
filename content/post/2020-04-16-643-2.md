Tonight I ventured to the supermarket. Two items of note;




      * my wife wrote a shopping list which included 1 block of strength 3 Cheddar cheese, 1 block of strength 4. I misread it and bought 3 blocks and 4 blocks respectively. So inadvertently I have now stockpiled cheeseâ€¦.
      * while waiting at the checkout a customer gave the young woman working the till a bunch of flowers, at which she promptly burst into tears. From what I could hear of the conversation she must have made a light hearted comment that no one ever bought her flowers. An act of kindness for someone doing an essential job.
