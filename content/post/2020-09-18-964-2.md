I am grateful to those who can write or speak honestly about their battle with mental illness. The above post from [Sameer Vasta](https://www.inthemargins.ca/about) popped up in my feed today. It isn't easy to be open about the things that go on in our heads, but what I can say to those who do, it is so valuable. Thank you.
