ðŸ“šJust finished reading [*I'll Keep You Safe*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35907150-i-ll-keep-you-safe?from_search=true&qid;=Q9E5B54Tr1&rank;=2) by Peter May - the first of his I have read and a lighter read before moving onto something more demanding. I enjoy crime fiction but I have to say, while his writing is fine, I thought the plot resolution was preposterous tosh. The big reveal at the end had even occurred to me as a possibility but thought it so ridiculous it would never happen!
