Heard my first Blackcaps of the year singing over the last couple of days. Still no swallows - with any luck they’ll turn up over the weekend. Bluetits still busy in the birdbox - don’t think they are building yet, a bit early. The robins seem to have been ousted from their nest box by a wren. They built their nest but a few days ago I realised that a wren was coming and going. Looks like he has just built the necessary on top of the robins nest.
