I haven't actually checked, but I think my posts here have become more sporadic. Haven't felt like I have much to say right now so the perennial voice in the background that asks 'what's the point?' has felt louder. In reality I know that at this time of year fatigue is a big player - hayfever and a busy time at work combine to cumulative effect. 

However, I'm not going to abandon the blog. Instead, I am going to re-evaluate my approach to it and perhaps do things a little differently. Or I may continue on as I am. Who knows?

A friend stepped back from their blog earlier this week. And a post from [Sameer Vasta](https://www.inthemargins.ca/) has popped up in my RSS app announcing that he his effectively closing his blog down after 25 years.

Is there something in the air? No. Just the ebb and flow of life. Nothing is permanent. But that does mean new things appear in the footsteps of the old. And my blog is supposed to evolve, not be a finished product. I hope I can find a better way to write.
