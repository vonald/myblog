A few weeks back I mentioned seeing [what I thought was a Barn owl ](https://strandlines.blog/90/). Since then, I am really pleased to have heard from two other people who have seen it, including being spotted hunting in a field not far from us. This is exactly what I have been hoping for - that it was finding prey in some of the rough grazing pasture around us.

As the evenings lengthen I hope to be able to get out around dusk and watch for it. Such a beautiful bird.
