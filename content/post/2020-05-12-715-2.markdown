Some apprehension today, as I am expecting it to be busier out and about, on the back of the government’s announcement encouraging a return to work.

I hope, I really do, that people will be considerate and make the effort to social distance themselves in busier places, with more of us around. _Most_ people are considerate, but I’ve seen enough of the small number who aren’t to think it a legitimate concern.
