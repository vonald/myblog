Can it really be [5 years ago](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron) today that we had the referendum on leaving the EU? Time flies - but I can't honestly say it's because we've been having fun. I still feel sad about what seems like an almighty act of self-sabotage.
