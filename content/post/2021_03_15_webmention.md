{{< microformats/content >}}I've fallen into the trap of fiddling around with the code for my blog rather than actual blogging. Having moved from Wordpress to Hugo, [as per my plan,](https://www.strandlines.blog/2021/02/18/2021_02_18_1335_blog_workflow/) I've been working on IndieWebifying the site. 

The most important aspect for me was to get webmentions working. I *think* this is working now. It did take a some joining of the dots for a non-techy person but I got there in the end. 

Note to self: I wanted to test to see if webmention.app would correctly notify me of a webmention when I published a test post linking to another post elsewhere on my site. I couldn't get any joy with that but looking around online it seems that it doesn't do self-referential mentions. 

Among others, I found the following pages useful;  
- [Sending your First Webmention from Scratch • Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/30/11/your-first-webmention)  
- [Adding Webmentions to My Static Hugo Site · Ana Ulin](https://anaulin.org/blog/adding-webmentions/)  
- [How I Integrated Webmentions Into My Hugo Static Site - Jayeless.net](https://www.jayeless.net/2021/02/integrating-webmentions-into-hugo.html)  

Consider this post a line in the sand: moving back to the act of blogging rather than playing around with the blog site. Even if it is a post *about* playing with the site. {{< /microformats/content >}}
