Finally managed to book my booster jab at a time that works for me. I've ended up checking several times a day as there are so few slots available and they get snapped up within minutes. So far they've all been at times that I can't do either.

I checked again just now and there is suddenly loads of availability so I've got one booked for an evening next week.
