I've moved the blog site over to [Render](https://render.com/). A very straightforward process, and I hope it works out. I'm sure, with a bit of digging, I could have got to the bottom of [the problem I was experiencing](https://strandlines.blog/2022/04/08/oh_netlify/) with Netlify, and was most likely user error. You know, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing kind of scenario.
