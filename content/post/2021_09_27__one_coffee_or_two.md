One coffee or two in the morning? Not about need - I just like coffee. 

And I only have just enough time for two, so I usually finish the second on my commute. I reckon if I limit myself to just the one, I would savour it more. Knowing I have a second one coming straight after the first somehow nullifies the enjoyment of the first. And the second one is never as enjoyable as the first. Hedonic adaptation perhaps, albeit a heavyweight term for drinking two beverages. 

Overthinking it? Maybe. 

But nothing wrong with fine-tuning habits.
