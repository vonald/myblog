Watched two films over the weekend. 

 [The White Tiger](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt6571548/). I found it really compelling. Reminded me of F. Scott Fitzgerald in its portrayal of the wealthy, their careless use of privilege and the subsequent collateral damage to those around them. Balram's charisma invites us to root for him, but in his efforts to break away from poverty his means-to-an-end methods render him no better.

[Annihilation](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/). Oozes atmosphere. The ideas explored are thought provoking as any good sci should be. I often find that the 'reveal' in sci-fi or horror can disappoint after a good build up. Annihilation is more successful in this regard, with enough ambiguity there to maintain the sense of mystery. Although the final scene still manages to slightly disappoint with its genre trope...
