The number of people in our village who have offered to run errands is impressive. Itâ€™s really heartening to see. So we have some offering to shop for groceries, or go to the Post Office, someone who works in the local pharmacy who can collect and deliver prescriptions and the local farm shop are going to prepare frozen meals for those that need them. Good to see such community spirit!
