Last autumn, I started [fiddling around with Tiddlywiki](https://strandlines.blog/975-2/) but for some reason which escapes me now, I didn't get that far with it. 

Teaching myself about Stoicism, I am rapidly collecting a vast list of links to articles, books to read, concepts to research. To help get this information into a more useful structure I've set up a new Tiddlywiki and started adding to it. 

I'll be interested to see how far I get this time.
