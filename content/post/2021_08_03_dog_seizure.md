Our dog had a seizure last night. Never happened before and distressing to see. Fortunately he seemed to have all his faculties in good order afterwards, other than being exhausted. The vet said the next 24hrs is the crucial period as if he has another it could leave him in a bad way or be fatal. So we are on watch. 

He has come through the night without anything further and seems to be his usual self. And the vet also said it could just be a one off. 

So fingers crossed.
