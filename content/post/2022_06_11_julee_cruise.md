Sad to see [Julee Cruise](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/10/julee-cruise-singer-david-lynch-collaborator-dies-aged-65-b52s) has died. I'm not familiar with her work other than appearing on Hybrid's outstanding 1999 debut album, [Wide Angle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Angle). An album that still stands up today, and will always be a classic for me.
