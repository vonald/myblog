Have intended to give sourdough a go for a little while now, so with it being the Thing To Do while we are hunkered down in our vaults, I decided now was the time. Got some great advice from [Jeremy Cherfas](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/) over at Micro.blog on getting a starter going, so thanks to him.

Started one last weekend and then this weekend made my first loaf. Really quite pleased with it. More dense than I hoped but was even textured and tasted delicious.
