The birds are getting very busy in our garden. All three nest boxes have had attention of some sort.

A pair of robins are nesting in one while a pair of blue tits seem very interested in another, spending a lot of time checking it out. The final box has been visited by great tits although Iâ€™m not confident yet that they will use it.

And the song thrush still sings on every morning.
