I'm really pleased to see John Moe is back with a new podcast, [Depresh Mode](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/depresh-mode/). I say new, but it's the same format as [The Hilarious World of Depression](https://www.hilariousworld.org). Which is a good thing, as John and his guests have a great way of talking about mental illness that is both head on and sensitive. Usually very sweary and always funny.

And while on the topic of podcasts, Messrs Kermode and Mayo have a new feature on their [Film Review](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvdrj/episodes/downloads). WTF or What's That Film?, where listeners send in some vague details of a film they watched in the distant past, and Mark and Simon try to work out what it was. With mixed success. 

It cracks me up and reminds me of the Mr Mann sketch from Little Britain where David Walliams goes into into the video store asking for a film with very detailed specificity. 

Which further leads me onto the same thing with books. Years ago I read a novel of which all I can recall is the following;
- the main character ends up looking for Nazis in South America 
- he finds a curious symbol several times used by the Nazis
- there is some suggestion of the involvement of aliens
- it was possibly part of a series

It was written in the fifties or sixties(probably). In my mind the author is well-known(that may not be the case), but I have never been able to remember enough to identify it. 

There needs to be a website where you can search for books based on a few details.....
