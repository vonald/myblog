Read [_Dissolution_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_(Sansom_novel)) by C J Sansom. Already familiar with the story from the BBC radio adaptation, although itâ€™s long enough ago that I listened to it to have forgotten who it was what dunnit.

Set during the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, itâ€™s a conventional but enjoyable and pacy historical murder mystery. Greed, lust, power, class and pond drainage. Somewhat in the vein of Ellis Peters' [Cadfael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadfael)Â series but with more bodily fluids. ðŸ“š
