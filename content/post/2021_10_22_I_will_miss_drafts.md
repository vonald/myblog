With my move to an Android phone, the app I shall miss the most is Drafts. I have a ton of actions that I've made, although there are only a handful I use regularly. Replicating what they achieve will take some work but I hope my recent efforts with Python are going to come in handy. 

Saving blog posts will be top of that list. The Drafts action I use adds the front matter with prompts for the url and tags, then saves it to Dropbox. Writing a Python script to enable me to do the same on Android - a weekend project?
