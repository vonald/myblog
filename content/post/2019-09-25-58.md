Leaving for work on Monday morning, a flat tyre. A wheel change, a trip to the tyre shop, half the morning gone, original plans scuppered, how best to use the rest of the day. Usually this leaves me feeling frustrated, stressed, guilty even. Not quite in control and my day wasted.







As it was I was able to catch up on some outstanding tasks; email clients, planning, that sort of thing. Which, of course, restored a little control. Salvaged the day.







Iâ€™m not good at letting go, adapting. I tend to hold on tighter. But maybe after forty-odd years, I am learning.
