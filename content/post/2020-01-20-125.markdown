Listening to [The Infinite Monkey Cage](https://pca.st/episode/a7667b4a-2f9c-48ad-8691-cf16eae2137a) last week, I learnt that both [rats](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rats-laugh-but-not-like-human/) and apes laugh. A quick search for laughing gorillas turned up [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uFDPLyAWpVg) of a young gorilla being tickled. I think I will save the link for moments when _I_ need a good laugh.
