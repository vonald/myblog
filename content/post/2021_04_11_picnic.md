Met up for a picnic and walk with friends yesterday. A somewhat chilly picnic but it warmed up as the afternoon went on. Just a relief to be able to get out and meet up. Quite busy, everyone enjoying their freedom but it was interesting how people were considerate, made an effort to maintain social distancing and most noticeably, seemed rather quiet and tired. Like we have all come out of our burrows, bleary-eyed and blinking in the sunshine.
