I am apt to wake far too early - sometimes an hour or more before I need to. During the summer I don’t mind too much but now the mornings are dark it’s not so easy. I am far too prone to start worrying about things, so I am trying out listening to music or meditation audio. It helps - the only thing is by the time I actually have to get up I can be just about ready to nod off again.
