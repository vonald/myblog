Watched [Mortal Engines](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1571234/) for a family film night. My son is a big fan of the books - I must read them myself. I know it got a bit of a panning, but I thought it was pretty good. Yes, at times it was derivative. Yes, at times the dialogue was clunky. But it had some good visuals and the story was enjoyable - we had a good time.
