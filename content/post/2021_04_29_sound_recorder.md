I have ordered a handheld recorder. 

I often use my phone to record birdsong or ambient sounds but obviously the quality is not great. Field recording appeals and I'd like to 'collect' sounds more. The kit that is coming means I can dip my toe into it a bit more and make some better quality recordings, all without spending vast amounts upfront.
