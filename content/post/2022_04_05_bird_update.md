First swallow of the year. Spotted briefly while I was out and about. Not one of ours but hope they are not far behind.

Our robins have three eggs, probably more to follow. I was able to take a quick peek while both adults were away from the nest. The blue tits have been busy carrying moss into their box.

Still a few winter migrants around; fieldfares and redwings. And spotted a peregrine soaring high above our village.
