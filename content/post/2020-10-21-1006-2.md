Had a problem with the contact form on our business’s website. Loads of spam plus genuine contacts were being labelled as spam too. In looking to solve this I considered using Captcha. In reading about it I discovered it’s a Google thing and, unsurprisingly, [collects a lot of data](https://www.fastcompany.com/90369697/googles-new-recaptcha-has-a-dark-side).

So I won’t be installing that then.
