I think that the [problems with my blog and Netlify](https://strandlines.blog/2021/07/18/effort_vs_frustration/) are reaching critical mass. I'm finding that I am put off from posting because of the hassle to then get it to show on the blog. 

I've decided that the first thing to tackle is a rebuild of the Raspberry Pi. The version of Hugo I have on there is not the newest - I inadvertently downloaded the wrong one and haven't got around to a delete and reinstall. 

There are also various things on there that I'm not using so another argument for a rebuild. First task is to [backup the whole SD image.](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/back-up-raspberry-pi)
