Came across [this research paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.12327)Â on social anxiety disorder and one sentence stood out, as it sheds some light on [the unresolved question](https://strandlines.blog/708-2/) of how can it take so long to realise there is something going on:



<blockquote>Owing to the early onset and chronicity of SAD, many individuals may also believe that these symptoms are part of their personality and therefore cannot be changed.</blockquote>



Makes me feel better.
