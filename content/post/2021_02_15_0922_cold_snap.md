Test. So that's the end of the cold snap. It is so different out there this morning - calm, misty and a positively balmy 9C. 

Over the last couple of days the cold weather has emboldened the birds again and this time a song thrush came to the bird table. They do come into the garden frequently but I've never seen one come this close to the house. 

It was very cautious initially, spending a lot of time looking around before dipping its head to take some food. It was also pretty shy of other birds so would fly off if others came to the table. Over time it appeared to become more confident spending less time looking around and more time feeding. They have beautiful markings and it's a real treat to see one so close.
