I followed the Ashes to a degree. The time difference plus the car-crash of a performance from England blunted my enthusiasm. If there was one positive to choose from, and there weren't many, I'd say it was Mark Wood's bowling. He just kept on running in. Whatever else was going on. So I'm glad he finally got his haul of wickets. He deserved it. 

I just long for a properly contested Test. That actually runs into the fifth day. I shall dream...
