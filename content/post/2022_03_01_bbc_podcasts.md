The BBC having been promoting changes that come into effect this month on how their podcasts can be accessed.

We are told that we can hear podcasts '28 days before anyone else, for free, on BBC Sounds.'

This seems to be a completely back-to-front way of saying we will no longer be able to get BBC podcasts on our app of choice when they are published. And not sure what this achieves either.
