The topic of what to do about the next phase of life has come up a lot in discussions between my wife and I of late. Although, to be honest, this particular discussion is one that has continued on and off for the entirety of our life together. And the 'next phase' is just the subsequent few years or decade following on from wherever we are at a given point in time. 

There is always the perennial question of how to instigate any changes for the future when our time is all but consumed by the present. Shortly after talking about this recently, a [post by Peter Rukavina](https://ruk.ca/content/%E2%80%9Cwalking-provides-inner-peace%E2%80%9D) popped up in my feed, touching on this very point. He has a way with words.

> This large question of whether you can plot your next move while still shoveling coal into the engine of the last, that’s something I’ve ruminated on for years. If I were laying out Social Safety Net 2.0, we’d all receive a paid year off at ages 30, 40, 50 and 60 to rest, gather our horses, walk purposelessly, and tease out the shape of the next decade of our lives.
