Found myself in circumstances earlier this week that set off major anxiety. I should have known it would happen as the anticipation had been rumbling around my head for days. It was the full on racing-thoughts-angry-sweating-tight-chested-backed-into-a-corner-fight-or-flight variety. Carried on for much of the day so I was exhausted by the end. 

What did help though was discussing it with my wife. She could see it going on so very sensibly suggested we take a moment to talk it over. And that helped in a big way. 

We both knew the other knew what was going on, but getting it out in the open helped diffuse my anxiety. I couldn't stop it altogether but an acknowledgment of the situation allowed me to take a step back, giving me the perspective of an observer more than a participant. 

And of course, the cascade of terrible scenarios that I had built up in my mind never happened.....
