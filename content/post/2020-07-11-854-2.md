ðŸŽµListening to...[Jon Hopkins - Insides](https://album.link/i/311180767). What a brilliant album. The track _Light through the veins_ sounded familiar. Itâ€™s on the intro and outro to Coldplayâ€™s _Viva la vida_. Turns out Brian Eno, who produced the album, got Jon Hopkins on board as well. Coldplay evidently liked his work!
