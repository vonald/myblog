Recently discovered a local nature reserve while exploring our area on bike. Can't quite believe I've lived here for 14 years and didn't know about this one. Alright, it's just a small area and not well known, so I can let myself off the hook. 

Took my son and dog for a walk there this morning.  Good bit of mixed woodland with some fine looking sweet chestnut trees. ![ ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y2a91lfnccps76b/IMG_5475-3.jpeg?raw=1)
