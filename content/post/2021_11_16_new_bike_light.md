I've just ordered a new bike light so that I can go for a blast around the lanes after dark. As per usual, I got bogged down with the sheer number of options available, but quickly narrowed it down once I realised that both Moon and Knog include models in their respective ranges with replaceable batteries. In the interest of both the environment and my pocket, this makes sense. 

I've gone for a Moon Meteor Storm Lite (surely coming up with a snappier name wouldn't have taken *that* much more effort?). Should be plenty of light for night riding, plus a decent day flash option.
