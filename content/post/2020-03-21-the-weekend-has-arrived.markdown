The weekend has arrived not a moment too soon. While there are a some practicalities to sort out I feel that some serious downtime is needed after a pretty draining week.

I am going to keep my news intake to the bare minimum. Go for a run. Maybe two. Watch a film. Read. Perhaps even a bit of gaming. Get out into the garden. And any of this could be on my own or with my family.

I am going to appreciate just being able to stop. Breathe. And remember the world is still turning.
