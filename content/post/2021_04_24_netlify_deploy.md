I have this weird thing going on with the blog and Netlify. When I upload a post to GitHub, Netlify is set to deploy automatically. Now, the auto deploy occurs but doesn't load the post. So I have to trigger a deploy manually, which works sometimes but not always. Hmmmmm. Time to get onto the Netlify forum.
