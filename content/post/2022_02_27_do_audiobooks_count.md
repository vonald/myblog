A question: When writing and later, printing, allowed reading to supersede oral traditions, did people question whether reading was a legitimate way to consume information and stories?

I find myself asking the same sort of question about audiobooks. Does listening to an audiobook count as having read it? There is always a little voice in the back of my mind that asks the question. 

In reality, I think it does, particularly given that oral traditions predate reading. And given that I have recently reinstated my membership of our county library, I now have free access to a vast array of audiobooks.

I *will* record them as having been read, along with printed books and I won't note which format they were. And that is the end of the matter.
