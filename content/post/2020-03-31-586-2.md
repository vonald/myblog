The mad thing is, now that we have all become hunter-gatherers again, my wife and I are going into shops more than we ever normally would. While we are not completely out of staple goods, we are finding it nigh on impossible to restock them.

Our village farm shop are being brilliant at supplying fresh produce and dairy goods. And we are still getting our weekly veg box. Presumably the panic-buyers will at some point run out of space in which to stockpile?

I was able to stop in a small shop this morning and get a few supplies. Never before have I felt such a burst of exhilaration from buying some cereal, two bags of pasta and a tin of kidney beans.
