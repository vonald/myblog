More fiddling around with the Raspberry pi over the break. Managed to add an SSL certificate to the Nextcloud server using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org) which has very easy to use instructions on the website. Next on the list is to learn about and implement some Bash scripts and cron jobs so that I can have to pi doing regular back-ups and such.
