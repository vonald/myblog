Welcome to my blog. I have started various blogs over the years, most of which have fizzled out for one reason or another. I like the discipline of writing - I think it is good for my brain.







Probably the main reason that I have not managed to keep blogging in the past is because most of the ones I have started are on a single topic. Because I tend to dabble in one thing, move on to something else, and then come back, I often found I lost momentum.







With this blog my aim is to cover any topic that interests me and therefore keep it up to date, I hope. We will see!
