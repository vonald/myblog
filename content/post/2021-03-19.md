I rarely use titles for posts. When I imported my data from Wordpress to Hugo all those posts without a title automatically received the distinctly unglamorous moniker 'None'. 

I could go through all them all and remove the offending front matter by hand. I have done so with a few. But I think it much more fun to set myself the challenge of writing a Widgety-Bash-Thingummy to do it all for me. 

It hasn't been at the top of my list of Things to Do but is inching up there as I resolve other issues with the site.
