Our Victoria plum tree is covered in buds so am hoping for a good crop this year. Yesterday I spotted a pigeon happily devouring them so shooed it away. Last year we didn’t get a single fruit for the same reason. I’m glad I saw the pigeon as it prompted me to get some netting over said tree in order to prevent further loss of blossom. Me - 1, pigeons - 0.

Walked in our local copse and good to see and hear several newly arrived Chiffchaffs. The most unremarkable looking bird but I love to see them.
