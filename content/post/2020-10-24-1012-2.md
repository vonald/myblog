I’m glad it’s the weekend and I can have a lie in. This last week was supposed to be straightforward but haha, not so.

Thursday afternoon, I had an unexpected change to my day which threw the good old anxiety into overdrive. The first time in a while that I have had such a big reaction and it left me exhausted. It all ran over into Friday where every small thing seemed imbued with far greater stress and significance than was really the case. On top of that, an email from my parents about their plans has set off alarm bells for my siblings and I.

Last night, I went to bed at 8:30pm, as I couldn’t stay awake. A restless night but overall feel better today. Going to take it slow today.
