I missed out on listening to the [cricket](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/scorecard/1152848/england-vs-australia-3rd-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021) yesterday, which was evidently a great day for Jofra Archer. Am able to listen today - not a great start for England but looks to be a fascinating dayâ€™s play.
