Now here's a weird thing. I've grumbled previously about the problems I've been having with Netlify deploying my site correctly. However, since switching to an Android phone, *each post I've published has been deployed immediately, first time*.

How does that work? Once formatted the markdown files are saved to Dropbox and thereafter the workflow is the same, regardless of whether I wrote it on iOS or Android. 

I'm sure someone with far greater expertise would know why. For me, it's some kind of dark magic.
