Before using [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) I had a blog on [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com). In fact, I’ve had more than one - all started with good intentions, but each has run aground. One reason is Wordpress itself. It is so feature rich that it would get in the way of what blogging is about - writing. And I’m not talking about being distracted by features.

I found using both the Wordpress app and website at best slow and clunky, at worst prone to freezing and crashing. Simply getting a post published was a tedious process. And with recent updates (blocks!) the experience only got worse.

And this is where I like Micro.blog. A nigh on frictionless experience. I can write and post, and within seconds my blog is updated.
