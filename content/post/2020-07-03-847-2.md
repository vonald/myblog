I have been messing around with OmniFocus. Again.

I tried it maybe a couple of years ago, but couldn’t quite justify committing to it. I think I might be heading the same way again.

I love the perspectives. And the organisation of projects.

But the lack of quick entry of tasks, a la Fantastical or Todoist is probably a deal breaker. And then I discovered that deferred tasks no longer show up in the Forecast view if the start date passes. Hmmmm.

I have the sneaking suspicion that I would end up doing a lot of tinkering, which is good fun and all, but maybe not the point.

Oh, and I like to have tasks become due on a day without having a notification for a specific hour. I like to be able to look at what needs to be done on the day and get on with it without necessarily scheduling in every task.

So that’s talked myself out of it again then, I guess?

Damn...
