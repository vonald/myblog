One of the reasons I switched to a Wordpress site for my blog was to use the IndieWeb plugin, in particular to enable webmentions. It takes a little more work to implement than a straightforward post but I like being able to do so. The ethos of the IndieWeb has a lot of appeal. Only thing is, I haven’t used them as much as I could.

I have saved links to numerous posts I that I’ve come across on other people’s blogs, with the intention of referencing them in my own posts via webmentions. I just need to take a bit more time, a little more effort and I’m sure I will appreciate the satisfaction of doing so.

Consider this a note to self.
