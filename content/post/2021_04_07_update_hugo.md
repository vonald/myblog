Still trying to get my head around how Hugo implements RSS. I thought I was there but then realised that my feed is only showing summaries of posts and not the full content. I know I edited the rss.xml file so that full content would be shown, but given the above, have to conclude that it was the wrong file. 

However, since then I read that it could be due to using a older version of Hugo, which is something I know I need to address. When I installed Hugo, against my better judgment I did so via a Linux package manager, which is a source usually several versions behind.

Given I also want to ditch the Nextcloud server, it's probably time to do a clean reinstall of the Raspberry Pi OS. Not a daunting task, but does require that I first check that everything that needs to be is backed up. 

Probably a job for the weekend.
