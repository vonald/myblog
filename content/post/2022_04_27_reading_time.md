Holidays present the possibility of reading a lot more than I usually find time for. In theory. In practice, they often don't. The holiday I have just had, the first since 2019 aside from a few days here or there, has been the exception.

Consequently, I was able to pick up on Robert Wright's Why Buddhism is True from [where I left off](https://strandlines.blog/2022/01/09/cycles/) and finish it.

Wright is someone who is not content to accept ideas on face value, in a good way. He has so many questions that he explores. This appeals to me. I think the book can be approached in two ways. Stop at every point and consider what is being said, at the risk of losing sight of the overarching theme. Or read through the whole thing so as to get the main ideas and then go back in detail. 

I think the latter is the better approach and I will certainly be revisiting it again.
