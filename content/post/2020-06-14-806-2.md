Blogging for me is a way to process thoughts. This is mostly an in-out system. Stuff happens, I think about it, I write.

Not everything ends up on the blog. Many sentences jotted down go no further. But things that need working out in more depth will probably end up as a post.

For the last week though, I’ve been in a log-jam. Too much to process.

Statues, protests, police violence, BLM, climate change, coronavirus, those that have, those that don’t, will a relation need cancer treatment, no school until September, how will we manage that, how are my elderly parents _really_ doing, what kind of world is my son growing up in, the van needs a service, I’d like more sleep.

I have enjoyed listening to the rain this week. And the blackbirds singing afterwards.
