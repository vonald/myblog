Two podcast episodes I have enjoyed this week: one old, one new, both related to Roman Mars.

Scientists use the opportunity the world being in lockdown presents to conduct research that would otherwise be impossible… [401- The Natural Experiment - 99% Invisible](https://pca.st/episode/02c6b74d-3ec6-4766-a56c-d99819da4ab4)

And a weird code related quirk… [140 The Roman Mars Mazda Virus - Reply All](https://pca.st/episode/04af6a67-1403-4007-ad83-5d38eb5ec605)
