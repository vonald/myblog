As an IndieWeb newbie I am very much still getting to grips with many aspects of applying the principles to my Wordpress blog. I had been struggling with how to implement reply-contexts until I came across this article by [Chris Aldrich](https://boffosocko.com/) where he explains very clearly how to use the [Post Kinds plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/). I hadn't discovered the Response Properties box available in the post editor up until this point, but now I have I can show neat looking links, excerpts and author details for anything that I am replying to or commenting on. This post being a case in point.
