On completing my 30 day meditation exercise,  [I mentioned noticing small changes](https://strandlines.blog/2022/03/20/thirty_day_meditation_goal/).

Initially I would frequently experience anger and frustration bubbling to the surface. Apparently, this is a common thing with meditation. By the end these were greatly diminished.  

I stopped thinking 'Are my 10 minutes nearly up?'. 

I began to notice how much I lack self-compassion. I started to be kinder to myself. 

I'm not sure I have seen much improvement yet in my ability to 'gently bring my attention back to my breath', as the instructions will often say. This aspect still feels like doing recall exercises with a terrier puppy....
