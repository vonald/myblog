As any parent will know, boundaries are there for children to test. And for my 10 year old, that means the physical boundaries - of our garden. Footballs, rugby balls, cricket balls, a space hopper (remember those? Yes, we have one). They all make frequent trips over the fence into our neighbours garden or the field. My 10 year old's power output currently far outstrips his accuracy and control.

Much as it frustrates me at times when I have to go and find a ball for the umpteenth time, I have to remind myself that this testing of the boundaries will stand him in good stead later in life. To question things, not accept the status quo. Because let's face it, we, the 'adults' in the room, have screwed it up pretty badly.
