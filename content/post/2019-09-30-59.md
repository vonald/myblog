The dry summer has lasted well into September. Funnily, it was early in the month that we used the wood burner on a couple of cooler evenings. The rest have been very mild. All change last week, with gales and plenty of much needed rain.







Yesterday we collected conkers. Have no use for them. Just like to look at them, enjoy the feel of them in the hand.
