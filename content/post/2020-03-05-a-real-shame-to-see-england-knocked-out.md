🏏A real shame to see England knocked out of the Women’s T20 World Cup in [this way](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/05/rain-scuppers-englands-chances-as-india-advance-to-world-t20-final). But them’s the rules.

However, now that Australia have beaten South Africa, I shall look forward to the Australia vs India final. And Poonam Yadav doing her thing.
