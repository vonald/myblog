I wanted to read an adventure/mystery novel that was not in the usual thriller or crime genres that I tend to read when I am in the mood for a good yarn. Picked on [â€ŽLabyrinth](https://books.apple.com/gb/book/labyrinth/id388177220) by _Kate Mosse_, based on having heard of her and aware her books are popular. Big mistake - what should have been an intriguing mystery was let down by two-dimensional characters and pretty dull writing. I had hoped for an enjoyable if undemanding page turner, but it was not to be.
