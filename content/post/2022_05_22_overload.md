I had to abandon work on Friday, after nearly passing out while in a discussion with a client. I'd been feeling none too great all morning. Went home and spent most of the remainder of the day in bed. A weekend of taking it easy and I feel largely back on track.

I think a  couple of weeks of poor sleep, anxiety about various things,  busyness at work and little to no breathing space in between all caught up on me. I was aware of the anxiety building - my chest had been feeling tighter all week. Without taking steps to give myself a break it's not really surprising then that my body finally said enough is enough. 

Funnily, I'd been reading about perfectionism earlier in the week. Recognised the trait in myself. Never cutting myself any slack. 

Just when you think this adulting thing is getting easier.....
