Two weeks ago I checked our various nest boxes and the one usually occupied by great tits was completely empty. 

I assumed that they weren't going to use it this year but in the last week we have noticed the male singing away nearby and one or the other of the pair leaving the box a few times. 

A quick check with my inspection camera on Sunday revealed a completed nest and at least one egg. 

They've not hung around then! Glad to have them back again.
