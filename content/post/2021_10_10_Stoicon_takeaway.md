I was able to watch three talks live at yesterday's [Stoicon](https://modernstoicism.com/event/stoicon-2021/) plus some other bits as well. 

Kai Whiting and Leonidas Konstantakos presented the first talk on The Equality of Moral Errors(sounds esoteric but was anything but), from which I learned about their book [Being Better: Stoicism for a World Worth Living in](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57251513-being-better?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=TAvVFapulV&rank=1). 

I've added this to my reading list as it goes into Stoicism and its relevance to social justice, climate breakdown and global capitalism - some of the issues that have prompted me to look to philosophy for answers.
