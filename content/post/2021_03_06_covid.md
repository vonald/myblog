Received a letter from the NHS inviting me to take part in their ongoing research into COVID-19 levels. Selection is at random and is entirely voluntary - I am happy to do my bit and become a statistic. 

It involves a short survey and then I'll receive a test kit in the post which will be collected by a courier once I've done it.
