Off to see Mum today. Up early, away by 7am. An easy drive and beautiful light. Gold and blue. A skein of geese passing over the motorway.

A much needed conversation. In a good way. Dadâ€™s health, mind and moving forward. Concerns laid bare. Mum feeling looked after.

Practicalities. Sorted a problem with their phone.

Then back home. A different route to avoid the holiday traffic.

Exhausted. But worth it.
