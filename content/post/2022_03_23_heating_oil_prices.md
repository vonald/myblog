Seeing headlines about current heating oil prices being 3 times the normal level, I thought I would check. Sure enough, got a quite from Boilerjuice and it came in at Â£1.55 a litre! I think at the last fill we paid about 45p. 

At least we are getting to the time of year when we can turn the heating off.
