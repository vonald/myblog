Session three of my CBT course this week. I was recommended for what they call High Intensity CBT and intense it most certainly is. For someone who’s sleep is not the best, this is one way to get a solid night’s rest.  When I received confirmation of the course, I knew it would be demanding, and I also knew that I didn’t really know just _how_ demanding. I just hope I have the wherewithal to see it to its conclusion and come away with some tools to help improve my mental health. 

 On the topic of mental health, or more specifically, social anxiety disorder, I read about the [tragic death of Errol Graham](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/28/disabled-man-starved-to-death-after-dwp-stopped-his-benefits), who had severe social anxiety and starved to death after his benefits were stopped by the DWP. This is so sad, an appalling failure on the part of the DWP and really shouldn’t happen in our society.
