Took a trip over to Steart Marshes yesterday. Happened to be a bright dry day in among the grey and murky ones. A cold wind - cleared the head after spending a lot of time indoors. Walked out to the Breach. 

Waders and wildfowl aplenty - lapwing, shelduck, redshank, curlew - but the highlight was a male hen harrier quartering the reed beds. I've only ever seen one before, years ago, and as a breeding species in the UK that is almost non-existent, to see a winter visitor was a real treat.
