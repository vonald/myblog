The blue tits that are using the nest box in our garden are getting much busier. Nest building is very much underway as can be seen in the picture below. I built and installed the box last year, and what they donâ€™t know is that it has a hinged roof, so I can take a peek inside. This is not just from idle curiosity but so that I can record the nest activity for the [BTO Nest Record Scheme](https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/nrs). They are such bossy birds and are great fun to watch.

There was a moment of alarm last weekend when I realised the box was leaning at an odd angle. Part of the fixings I had used to attach it to the tree had come loose. Fortunately I was able to do a quick repair job without disturbing the birds - hence the string now tied around the box. Disaster averted!
