Setting the clocks forward an hour last weekend should dictate that I have trouble waking up early enough. So as the exception to prove the rule, I have woken at about 4:30am most mornings since, which a week ago would have been 3:30am. Go figure. 

I've been keeping my eyes peeled for more swallows but none so far beyond the [lone arrival on Tuesday](https://strandlines.blog/2021/03/30/first_swallow/).

Thursday was exceptionally hazy with [Saharan dust](https://twitter.com/metoffice/status/1377525671476477952?s=21). The briefest of showers deposited a disproportionate and comical quantity of dust on the car. 

Had my Covid jab this morning. Looked to be a very efficient setup at our local community hospital. A sterling effort being made by the NHS and volunteers. Just starting to feel under the weather. Fingers crossed that it won't get any worse than this.
