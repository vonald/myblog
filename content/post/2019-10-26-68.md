Have been watching [Life on Mars](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b006t85s/life-on-mars), currently available on the BBC iPlayer, and which I somehow missed first time around. Am enjoying the era-specific references, including a [View-Master](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-Master). I had one of these as a kid and had completely forgotten! Kids today donâ€™t know what they are missing...
