On further reflection it is probably for the best that we can’t get grocery deliveries online, as we are able to go out and hopefully it is those who need to self-isolate who are booking up the delivery slots. However, the cynic in me suspects that is not the case.

A business just down the road that supplies pubs and restaurants expects to last no more than a week, now that demand has disappeared. I hope our government puts measures in place post-haste so that all the businesses facing a similar situation don’t just go to the wall.

On a positive note, since posting yesterday a couple of residents have volunteered to coordinate getting supplies to those in the village who need it. Which is just what was needed.
