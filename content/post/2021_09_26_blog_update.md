I am aware that the frequency of my posts has dropped off. As opposed to [when I wrote about a similar thing back in May](https://strandlines.blog/2021/05/19/on_-mental_health_blogging/), this has not been about a lack of confidence or arguments in my head about authenticity. Rather, this is about having too much to write about. 

I have been enjoying myself delving deeper into Stoicism, Buddhism and various related topics. The only thing is, and this is perhaps one of the strengths/weaknesses of the internet, it's very easy to leap from idea to concept to idea and so on. Reading about one aspect usually throws up questions that require further research and as it is so easy to then look into those, I just follow my nose.

I have been journaling alongside the research, which is a habit I have wanted to develop. But when it has come to writing for the blog I haven't found that so easy. Probably because ideas have merged into each other and I haven't taken the time to tease them out into post sized chunks. Additionally, I've not been updating my Tiddlywiki for the same reason, the purpose of which was to be a note-taking and organising tool.

This is all to say that I *should* start posting more about these topics and taking notes. Although 'shoulds' are real inspiration killers - as soon as one appears my brain just digs it's heels in. So I've made a real effort not to put myself under any pressure. Which means, of course, that subconsciously, I have.

Eventually, the natural ebb and flow of motivation will mean a more frequent posting phase will come around again.
