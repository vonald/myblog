I *need* another Raspberry Pi but they are virtually impossible to get hold of at the moment. I assume it's down to the Big Chip Problem.

I've ordered a temp/pressure/humidity sensor as I want to set up a basic weather station. For the time being I will use my one and only Pi until I can get hold of a Pi Zero. 

I've been doing a lot of Python coding of late but setting up a sensor will be new territory. The aim will then be to have the data fed live to browser based dashboard such as [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/)
