In my endless search for the ultimate note-taking/writing app, I have been using [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com) for a couple of months. Just found that on the iPhone there is a problem selecting text - when I try to drag the handles they disappear. 

Did my usual knee-jerk reaction and looked for other apps. I came across [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org) and am giving it a go. Quite like it so far.
