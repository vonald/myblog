I've learnt that the underlying principles of CBT come from Stoicism. I can't recall where I read that now, but I've spent the last few days down the Stoic rabbit hole. I've binge-listened to a number of podcasts on the topic. I've made a list of books both contemporary and classical to read. To start me off I've bought Donald J Robertson's [Stoicism and the Art of Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17841317-stoicism-and-the-art-of-happiness?from_search=true).  It's at the self-help end of the spectrum but because the author is a psychotherapist it goes into how CBT and Stoicism relate to each other. 

Although I don't think CBT and I [got along too well](https://strandlines.blog/998-2/) when I had my course of therapy last year, the applied rationality appealed to me. In addition, I've been dipping my toes into the world of philosophy. So to discover that the two areas of thinking intersect has really piqued my interest.
