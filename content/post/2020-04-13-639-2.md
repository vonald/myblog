Watched [Bumblebee](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt4701182/) with the family yesterday. I have zero investment in the Transformers world but thought it very enjoyable. My 10yr old gave it a big thumbs up. Really liked the '80s milieu and cultural references. Good to see a female protagonist and thought the CGI was good - the robots had solidity and weight to them. A fun family action film with a lot of heart.
