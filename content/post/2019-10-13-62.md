A recent podcast series I have enjoyed is [The Case of Charles Dexter Ward](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06spb8w). Based on the H.P. Lovecraft novel of the same name, it is given a modern setting and presented in the style of a true crime podcast, neatly sidestepping [Lovecraftâ€™s writing style](https://howtowritelike.com/2019/02/06/how-to-write-like-h-p-lovecraft/). Enjoyable hokum.
