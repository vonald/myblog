The hosting for my blog is up for renewal in a month or so. It occurred to me to look into the viability of using the raspberry pi as the web server, making it a truly self-hosted blog.

From what I’ve read it should be ok for a site that doesn’t have much traffic - that’s definitely mine! I will try setting up a dummy site before making it live, probably using a ‘flat file’ type cms.
