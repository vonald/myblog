Am involved with looking after our community woodland. Yesterday, went to look at a piece of woodland left to the local parish council in someone’s will. The wood is only about 20 years old, but some older trees exist along the boundaries. Found this Hornbeam, a tree I rarely see as such a large specimen. I wouldn’t like to guess it’s age but so nice to see one this large.
