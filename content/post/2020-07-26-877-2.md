[After nearly deleting Omnifocus](https://strandlines.blog/847-2/), I paid for a month’s subscription and have been giving some more time to it. But I have also been using Things 3. I bought this for my iPad quite a while ago and enjoyed using it other than it being very date focussed, which doesn’t really suit my style. In addition it doesn’t have an equivalent of perspectives in Omnifocus.

However, since I last used Things, a comprehensive URL scheme has been implemented and this is a game changer, enabling the creation of Shortcuts in IOS that emulate perspectives pretty well.
