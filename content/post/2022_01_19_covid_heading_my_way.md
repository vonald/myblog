I am running into more people I know that have either had Covid or had to isolate over the last month, than at any other time during the pandemic. 

Various appointments or meet ups cancelled and several of my son's classmates have had to take time off. 

It feels like there is an inevitability to catching it sooner or later. Not fatalism, but rather mental preparation for being stuck at home when I'd rather not.
