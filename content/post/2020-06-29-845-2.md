I’ve just come out of a particularly long rabbit hole. Have spent the last 10 days or so obsessively learning more about automation and scripting in the context of task managers, URL schemes, Drafts and Shortcuts.

One of those occasions where the enjoyment of discovery meant other things didn’t get my attention, like reading and blogging.

I _think_ my efforts have paid off. I have to get on now and use what I’ve learnt and not just continue trying out more ideas.

Oh, but the tinkering…
