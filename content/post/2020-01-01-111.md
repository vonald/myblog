8am today, a Â Song thrush was singing from a tree just beyond our garden. Not its sub-song as might be expected at this time of year, but full song. Fantastic to hear it - felt like a spring morning. A good way to start the New Year. [Have a listen](https://soundcloud.com/strandlinesaudio/20200101-songthrush) - also a Robin singing and a scolding Blue Tit.
