Given that everyone in the UK has decided to go camping this year, we are making the most of it and selling surplus camping/van gear on eBay.

It’s a few years since I last sold anything on eBay and I had forgotten about all the emails asking questions …

Can I collect? _No, it’s delivery only, like it says in the listing_

Can you post it? _No, it’s collect only, like it says in the listing_

Can I pay cash? _No, PayPal only, like its says…._

Have you got a Buy It Now price? _No, it’s auction only, like…_
