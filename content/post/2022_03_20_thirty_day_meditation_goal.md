Heard an interview with [Sharon Salzberg](https://www.sharonsalzberg.com/) a few weeks ago, in which she mentioned, if I recall correctly, that research has shown that doing ten minutes of mindfulness meditation a day, for thirty days, has a noticeable impact.

At the time, I was struggling to maintain any kind of meditation practice, but despite not generally being into setting this kind of goal, I decided to give it a try. Thirty days is not so long, is it?

This week, I completed my goal. Have I noticed any change or impact?

I would say yes, if incremental, but sufficient to make me want to continue.
