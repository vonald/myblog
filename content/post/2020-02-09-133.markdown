Plan A was to go and do a bird survey this morning. Storm Ciara has rather put paid to that. Not that I am averse to being out in inclement weather but there are limits. Plus the practicalities of trying to see and count birds in rain and gales...

So to Plan B. Stay indoors, enjoy a roast with my family for lunch and recharge from a demanding week.
