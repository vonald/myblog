Whether it's books, TV series, blogging, or whatever, I am having to accept that my interest in something cycles. I always tell myself that consistency is what I 'should' aim for. But the reality is that I dive into something with enthusiasm for a time and then all motivation drains away.

Take, for example Robert Wright's Why Buddhism is True. Started it months ago. Completely fascinated by what he has to say. Got half way through. Haven't touched it now for maybe six weeks. I can't muster the effort at the moment. But why was it so easy to start with?

I know I will return to it in due course. I'd like to learn to tell myself that's just fine.
