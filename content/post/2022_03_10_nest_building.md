I spotted a robin with nesting material in our shed this morning. I later saw it leaving the nest box we have in there, so I'm pleased to see they are using it. A pair of blue tits checked out another nest box a few weeks ago but it's a little early for them to start to build yet. 

And I've yet to see any great tits visit the box they usually use, but that doesn't mean a thing as we've learnt that they can manage to build a nest without us having any idea until they've got eggs in there.
