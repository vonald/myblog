There is a lane near us running alongside some woodland that is open to the public. It's fair to say the road has seen an increase in traffic over the pandemic, given more people seem to be using the wood for exercise. As a result the already poor road surface has deteriorated badly with several potholes opening up. 

A couple of weeks ago I noticed red marker paint around the worst of the holes. Given the usual glacial pace that these things seem to move at, I was pleasantly surprised this morning to see the holes have been patched. So well done Highways Agency or whoever is responsible. 

Clearly though, there is something of the arcane to the decision making process here, because why only repair some of the holes?
