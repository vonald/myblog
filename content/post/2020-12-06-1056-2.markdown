I’ve got up far too early for a Sunday. For any day, come to that. I decided it would be a good idea to set up the Xbox in advance of Christmas and load a couple of games onto it. Mainly so the process doesn’t dominate Christmas Day. That way, it can be presented to my son ‘oven ready’, to use a topical phrase, only in the case of the Xbox, it may actually be true. Hopefully.

The only thing is, the update required on start up is taking so long, I might actually be waiting here until Christmas.
