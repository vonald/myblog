I had a text from my bank telling me that from time to time, when I pay using contactless I will be asked to enter my PIN. Just to make sure itâ€™s really me. 

Next year, I imagine that when I enter my PIN, I will be occasionally asked to sign a small piece of paper - just to check that it really is me.
