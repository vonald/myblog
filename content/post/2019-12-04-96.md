At the weekend we watched [_Arrival_](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/?ref=m_nv_sr_1). It has been on my list of films to see and happened to be on TV. A really thought provoking film and for me the kind of storytelling when sci-fi is at its best. I will now have to read the novella it is based on - [_Story of Your Life_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life) by Ted Chiang.

Funnily, I was thinking about [_Bladerunner 2049_](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/) - another of Denis Villeneuve's films, after reading [Colin Walkerâ€™s post](https://colinwalker.blog/2019/11/28/) about watching it on his phone. I have yet to see it, having hesitated to do so after watching [_Sicario_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3397884/) for which my expecations were high. Yet another of Villeneuve's films, I had heard great things about _Sicario_ but was disappointed with it. Great set pieces and music, but I thought Emily Blunt's character lacked agency, rendering her a mere observer. Maybe that was the point but it didn't work for me (yes, I know she was there as an FBI agent in order to legitimise the operation etc).

_Bladerunner_ holds a special place in my imagination - any sequel has to measure up, and based on _Sicario_ and my reaction to it, I haven't quite got around to watching _2049_ yet. However, having now seen _Arrival_ and thought it had some heft to it, I think I can go ahead and watch _Bladerunner 2049_ with confidence.

This makes me wonder how much it pays to know about a film in advance of viewing it? Obviously you have to have enough information to decide whether it is for you or not. I had _Sicario_ on my list of must see films after hearing [Mark Kermode's review](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p034t459) and it was almost like I knew _too_ much about it and his opinion, meaning I had a specific expectation that was ultimately not met.

On the other hand, I knew very little about _Arrival_ and consequently was able to watch it with few preconceptions to get in the way. I just took it as it came and as such was a better viewing experience for it. I will have to watch _Sicario_ again at a later date, and maybe it will work better on a second viewing.
