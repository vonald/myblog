Went outside about 6:30 this morning and realised the blue tits were fledging. Much calling and coaxing from the parents, at least a couple young in the walnut tree and another peeping out of the nest box. 

Told my wife and by the time we went to look a few minutes later they were all gone. We've noticed this before - they really don't hang around. With various magpies and jackdaws hanging around on the chance of a tasty breakfast, it's not surprising.
