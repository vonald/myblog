Had a long chat with the Aged Parents about their moving plans and contrary to [my concerns](https://strandlines.blog/1012-2/) they seem to be taking a more realistic and pragmatic approach to things. It’s strange, edging closer to being a carer, not that they need ‘care’ as such yet, but greater involvement is going to become the norm.
