Most years we get a few common whitethroats in the area where we live. Usually see them sitting atop a hedge or clump of brambles singing. Not that it's that much of a song - short and scratchy. But I rather like it.

I've been hearing one for the last week when I'm out in the garden. Even heard it coming from somewhere within the garden. Then on Sunday while I was sitting outside, it turned up for a bit of a splash in our birdbath. Then sat in a nearby bush and had a good preen. And again yesterday.

Which was really rather delightful.
