Our dog had another seizure last night. Fortunately I was still up, so was able to be there while it happened. Again, he seems none the worse for wear, other than the exhaustion from the seizure and the drugs that make him a tad wobbly for a few hours. I slept downstairs on the sofa to keep en eye on him, as per the vets advice, but no further happenings. 

Now that he has had a second I guess it makes it more likely that there is an underlying problem. At nearly fifteen he has had a good innings so for however much longer we have him, we want to him to be happy and for us to enjoy his company.
